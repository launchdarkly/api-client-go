  description: "# Overview\n\n## Authentication\n\nLaunchDarkly's REST API uses the\
    \ HTTPS protocol with a minimum TLS version of 1.2.\n\nAll REST API resources\
    \ are authenticated with either [personal or service access tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens),\
    \ or session cookies. Other authentication mechanisms are not supported. You can\
    \ manage personal access tokens on your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens)\
    \ page.\n\nLaunchDarkly also has SDK keys, mobile keys, and client-side IDs that\
    \ are used by our server-side SDKs, mobile SDKs, and JavaScript-based SDKs, respectively.\
    \ **These keys cannot be used to access our REST API**. These keys are environment-specific,\
    \ and can only perform read-only operations such as fetching feature flag settings.\n\
    \n| Auth mechanism                                                           \

    \                             |\n\n> #### Keep your access tokens and SDK keys\
    \ private\n>\n> Access tokens should _never_ be exposed in untrusted contexts.\
    \ Never put an access token in client-side JavaScript, or embed it in a mobile\
    \ application. LaunchDarkly has special mobile keys that you can embed in mobile\
    \ apps. If you accidentally expose an access token or SDK key, you can reset it\
    \ from your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens)\
    \ page.\n>\n> The client-side ID is safe to embed in untrusted contexts. It's\
    \ designed for use in client-side JavaScript.\n\n### Authentication using request\
    \ header\n\nThe preferred way to authenticate with the API is by adding an `Authorization`\
    \ header containing your access token to your requests. The value of the `Authorization`\
    \ header must be your access token.\n\nManage personal access tokens from the\
    \ [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\n\
    \n### Authentication using session cookie\n\nFor testing purposes, you can make\
    \ API calls directly from your web browser. If you are logged in to the LaunchDarkly\
    \ application, the API will use your existing session to authenticate calls.\n\
    \nIf you have a [role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/built-in-roles)\
    \ other than Admin, or have a [custom role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/custom-roles)\
    \ defined, you may not have permission to perform some API calls. You will receive\
    \ a `401` response code in that case.\n\n> ### Modifying the Origin header causes\
    \ an error\n>\n> LaunchDarkly validates that the Origin header for any API request\
    \ authenticated by a session cookie matches the expected Origin header. The expected\
    \ Origin header is `https://app.launchdarkly.com`.\n>\n> If the Origin header\
    \ does not match what's expected, LaunchDarkly returns an error. This error can\
    \ prevent the LaunchDarkly app from working correctly.\n>\n> Any browser extension\
    \ that intentionally changes the Origin header can cause this problem. For example,\
    \ the `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` Chrome extension changes the Origin header\
    \ to `http://evil.com` and causes the app to fail.\n>\n> To prevent this error,\
    \ do not modify your Origin header.\n>\n> LaunchDarkly does not require origin\
    \ matching when authenticating with an access token, so this issue does not affect\
    \ normal API usage.\n\n## Representations\n\nAll resources expect and return JSON\
    \ response bodies. Error responses also send a JSON body. To learn more about\
    \ the error format of the API, read [Errors](/#section/Overview/Errors).\n\nIn\
    \ practice this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type` header\
    \ set to `application/json`.\n\nIn addition, request bodies for `PATCH`, `POST`,\
    \ and `PUT` requests must be encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header set\
    \ to `application/json`.\n\n### Summary and detailed representations\n\nWhen you\
    \ fetch a list of resources, the response includes only the most important attributes\
    \ of each resource. This is a _summary representation_ of the resource. When you\
    \ fetch an individual resource, such as a single feature flag, you receive a _detailed\
    \ representation_ of the resource.\n\nThe best way to find a detailed representation\
    \ is to follow links. Every summary representation includes a link to its detailed\
    \ representation.\n\n### Expanding responses\n\nSometimes the detailed representation\
    \ of a resource does not include all of the attributes of the resource by default.\
    \ If this is the case, the request method will clearly document this and describe\
    \ which attributes you can include in an expanded response.\n\nTo include the\
    \ additional attributes, append the `expand` request parameter to your request\
    \ and add a comma-separated list of the attributes to include. For example, when\
    \ you append `?expand=members,roles` to the [Get team](/tag/Teams#operation/getTeam)\
    \ endpoint, the expanded response includes both of these attributes.\n\n### Links\
    \ and addressability\n\nThe best way to navigate the API is by following links.\
    \ These are attributes in representations that link to other resources. The API\
    \ always uses the same format for links:\n\n- Links to other resources within\
    \ the API are encapsulated in a `_links` object\n- If the resource has a corresponding\
    \ link to HTML content on the site, it is stored in a special `_site` link\n\n\
    Each link has two attributes:\n\n- An `href`, which contains the URL\n- A `type`,\
    \ which describes the content type\n\nFor example, a feature resource might return\
    \ the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"parent\": {\n      \"href\"\
    : \"/api/features\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"self\"\
    : {\n      \"href\": \"/api/features/sort.order\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\
    \n    }\n  },\n  \"_site\": {\n    \"href\": \"/features/sort.order\",\n    \"\
    type\": \"text/html\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom this, you can navigate to the parent\
    \ collection of features by following the `parent` link, or navigate to the site\
    \ page for the feature by following the `_site` link.\n\nCollections are always\
    \ represented as a JSON object with an `items` attribute containing an array of\
    \ representations. Like all other representations, collections have `_links` defined\
    \ at the top level.\n\nPaginated collections include `first`, `last`, `next`,\
    \ and `prev` links containing a URL with the respective set of elements in the\
    \ collection.\n\n## Updates\n\nResources that accept partial updates use the `PATCH`\
    \ verb. Most resources support the [JSON patch](/reference#updates-using-json-patch)\
    \ format. Some resources also support the [JSON merge patch](/reference#updates-using-json-merge-patch)\
    \ format, and some resources support the [semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch)\
    \ format, which is a way to specify the modifications to perform as a set of executable\
    \ instructions. Each resource supports optional [comments](/reference#updates-with-comments)\
    \ that you can submit with updates. Comments appear in outgoing webhooks, the\
    \ audit log, and other integrations.\n\nWhen a resource supports both JSON patch\
    \ and semantic patch, we document both in the request method. However, the specific\
    \ request body fields and descriptions included in our documentation only match\
    \ one type of patch or the other.\n\n### Updates using JSON patch\n\n[JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902)\
    \ is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON patch uses\
    \ paths and a limited set of operations to describe how to transform the current\
    \ state of the resource into a new state. JSON patch documents are always arrays,\
    \ where each element contains an operation, a path to the field to update, and\
    \ the new value.\n\nFor example, in this feature flag representation:\n\n```json\n\
    {\n    \"name\": \"New recommendations engine\",\n    \"key\": \"engine.enable\"\
    ,\n    \"description\": \"This is the description\",\n    ...\n}\n```\nYou can\
    \ change the feature flag's description with the following patch document:\n\n\
    ```json\n[{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"This\
    \ is the new description\" }]\n```\n\nYou can specify multiple modifications to\
    \ perform in a single request. You can also test that certain preconditions are\
    \ met before applying the patch:\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"op\": \"test\", \"path\"\
    : \"/version\", \"value\": 10 },\n  { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\"\
    , \"value\": \"The new description\" }\n]\n```\n\nThe above patch request tests\
    \ whether the feature flag's `version` is `10`, and if so, changes the feature\
    \ flag's description.\n\nAttributes that are not editable, such as a resource's\
    \ `_links`, have names that start with an underscore.\n\n### Updates using JSON\
    \ merge patch\n\n[JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386)\
    \ is another format for specifying the modifications to perform on a resource.\
    \ JSON merge patch is less expressive than JSON patch. However, in many cases\
    \ it is simpler to construct a merge patch document. For example, you can change\
    \ a feature flag's description with the following merge patch document:\n\n```json\n\
    {\n  \"description\": \"New flag description\"\n}\n```\n\n### Updates using semantic\
    \ patch\n\nSome resources support the semantic patch format. A semantic patch\
    \ is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource as a set of executable\
    \ instructions.\n\nSemantic patch allows you to be explicit about intent using\
    \ precise, custom instructions. In many cases, you can define semantic patch instructions\
    \ independently of the current state of the resource. This can be useful when\
    \ defining a change that may be applied at a future date.\n\nTo make a semantic\
    \ patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to\
    \ your `Content-Type` header.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```\nContent-Type: application/json;\
    \ domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch\n```\n\nIf you call a semantic patch\
    \ resource without this header, you will receive a `400` response because your\
    \ semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON patch.\n\nThe body of a semantic\
    \ patch request takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional)\
    \ A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some\
    \ resources only) The environment key.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A\
    \ list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an\
    \ object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the instruction\
    \ requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields\
    \ in the object. The documentation for each resource that supports semantic patch\
    \ includes the available instructions and any additional parameters.\n\nFor example:\n\
    \n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [ {\"\
    kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"} ]\n}\n```\n\nIf any instruction in the patch encounters\
    \ an error, the endpoint returns an error and will not change the resource. In\
    \ general, each instruction silently does nothing if the resource is already in\
    \ the state you request.\n\n### Updates with comments\n\nYou can submit optional\
    \ comments with `PATCH` changes.\n\nTo submit a comment along with a JSON patch\
    \ document, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is\
    \ a comment string\",\n  \"patch\": [{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\"\
    , \"value\": \"The new description\" }]\n}\n```\n\nTo submit a comment along with\
    \ a JSON merge patch document, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\"\
    : \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"merge\": { \"description\": \"New flag description\"\
    \ }\n}\n```\n\nTo submit a comment along with a semantic patch, use the following\
    \ format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"instructions\"\
    : [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"} ]\n}\n```\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API always returns\
    \ errors in a common format. Here's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"code\": \"\
    invalid_request\",\n  \"message\": \"A feature with that key already exists\"\
    ,\n  \"id\": \"30ce6058-87da-11e4-b116-123b93f75cba\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `code` indicates\
    \ the general class of error. The `message` is a human-readable explanation of\
    \ what went wrong. The `id` is a unique identifier. Use it when you're working\
    \ with LaunchDarkly Support to debug a problem with a specific API call.\n\n###\

    \                                      |\n\n## CORS\n\nThe LaunchDarkly API supports\
    \ Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. If an\
    \ `Origin` header is given in a request, it will be echoed as an explicitly allowed\
    \ origin. Otherwise the request returns a wildcard, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:\
    \ *`. For more information on CORS, read the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors).\
    \ Example CORS headers might look like:\n\n```http\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers:\
    \ Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods:\
    \ OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAccess-Control-Max-Age:\
    \ 300\n```\n\nYou can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin\
    \ calls, using either [token or session-based authentication](/#section/Overview/Authentication).\
    \ If you are using session authentication, you should set the `withCredentials`\
    \ property for your `xhr` request to `true`. You should never expose your access\
    \ tokens to untrusted entities.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nWe use several rate limiting\
    \ strategies to ensure the availability of our APIs. Rate-limited calls to our\
    \ APIs return a `429` status code. Calls to our APIs include headers indicating\
    \ the current rate limit status. The specific headers returned depend on the API\
    \ route being called. The limits differ based on the route, authentication mechanism,\
    \ and other factors. Routes that are not rate limited may not contain any of the\
    \ headers described below.\n\n> ### Rate limiting and SDKs\n>\n> LaunchDarkly\
    \ SDKs are never rate limited and do not use the API endpoints defined here. LaunchDarkly\
    \ uses a different set of approaches, including streaming/server-sent events and\
    \ a global CDN, to ensure availability to the routes used by LaunchDarkly SDKs.\n\
    \n### Global rate limits\n\nAuthenticated requests are subject to a global limit.\
    \ This is the maximum number of calls that your account can make to the API per\
    \ ten seconds. All service and personal access tokens on the account share this\
    \ limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token will impact other tokens.\
    \ Calls that are subject to global rate limits may return the headers below:\n\
    \n| Header name                    | Description                             \
    \                                         |\n| ------------------------------\
    \ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Global-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests the account\
    \ is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`            |\
    \ The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.\
    \    |\n\nWe do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be\
    \ made globally. This limit may change, and we encourage clients to program against\
    \ the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding\
    \ to the current limit.\n\n### Route-level rate limits\n\nSome authenticated routes\
    \ have custom rate limits. These also reset every ten seconds. Any service or\
    \ personal access tokens hitting the same route share this limit, so exceeding\
    \ the limit with one access token may impact other tokens. Calls that are subject\
    \ to route-level rate limits return the headers below:\n\n| Header name      \
    \             | Description                                                  \
    \                                         |\n| ----------------------------- |\
    \ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Route-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests to the current\
    \ route the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`\
    \           | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch\
    \ milliseconds.                         |\n\nA _route_ represents a specific URL\
    \ pattern and verb. For example, the [Delete environment](/tag/Environments#operation/deleteEnvironment)\
    \ endpoint is considered a single route, and each call to delete an environment\
    \ counts against your route-level rate limit for that route.\n\nWe do not publicly\
    \ document the specific number of calls that an account can make to each endpoint\
    \ per ten seconds. These limits may change, and we encourage clients to program\
    \ against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather\
    \ than hardcoding to the current limits.\n\n### IP-based rate limiting\n\nWe also\
    \ employ IP-based rate limiting on some API routes. If you hit an IP-based rate\
    \ limit, your API response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how\
    \ long to wait before re-trying the call. Clients must wait at least `Retry-After`\
    \ seconds before making additional calls to our API, and should employ jitter\
    \ and backoff strategies to avoid triggering rate limits again.\n\n## OpenAPI\
    \ (Swagger) and client libraries\n\nWe have a [complete OpenAPI (Swagger) specification](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/openapi.json)\
    \ for our API.\n\nWe auto-generate multiple client libraries based on our OpenAPI\
    \ specification. To learn more, visit the [collection of client libraries on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-api+org%3Alaunchdarkly&type=Repositories).\
    \ You can also use this specification to generate client libraries to interact\
    \ with our REST API in your language of choice.\n\nOur OpenAPI specification is\
    \ supported by several API-based tools such as Postman and Insomnia. In many cases,\
    \ you can directly import our specification to explore our APIs.\n\n## Method\
    \ overriding\n\nSome firewalls and HTTP clients restrict the use of verbs other\
    \ than `GET` and `POST`. In those environments, our API endpoints that use `DELETE`,\
    \ `PATCH`, and `PUT` verbs are inaccessible.\n\nTo avoid this issue, our API supports\
    \ the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, allowing clients to \"tunnel\" `DELETE`,\
    \ `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests using a `POST` request.\n\nFor example, to call\
    \ a `PATCH` endpoint using a `POST` request, you can include `X-HTTP-Method-Override:PATCH`\
    \ as a header.\n\n## Beta resources\n\nWe sometimes release new API resources\
    \ in **beta** status before we release them with general availability.\n\nResources\
    \ that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change\
    \ without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.\n\nWe try to promote\
    \ resources into general availability as quickly as possible. This happens after\
    \ sufficient testing and when we're satisfied that we no longer need to make backwards-incompatible\
    \ changes.\n\nWe mark beta resources with a \"Beta\" callout in our documentation,\
    \ pictured below:\n\n> ### This feature is in beta\n>\n> To use this feature,\
    \ pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`.\
    \ Use this header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](/#section/Overview/Beta-resources).\n\
    >\n> Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development.\
    \ They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.\n\
    \n### Using beta resources\n\nTo use a beta resource, you must include a header\
    \ in the request. If you call a beta resource without this header, you receive\
    \ a `403` response.\n\nUse this header:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: beta\n```\n\n\
    ## Federal environments\n\nThe version of LaunchDarkly that is available on domains\
    \ controlled by the United States government is different from the version of\
    \ LaunchDarkly available to the general public. If you are an employee or contractor\
    \ for a United States federal agency and use LaunchDarkly in your work, you likely\
    \ use the federal instance of LaunchDarkly.\n\nIf you are working in the federal\
    \ instance of LaunchDarkly, the base URI for each request is `https://app.launchdarkly.us`.\
    \ In the \"Try it\" sandbox for each request, click the request path to view the\
    \ complete resource path for the federal environment.\n\nTo learn more, read [LaunchDarkly\
    \ in federal environments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/advanced/federal).\n\
    \n## Versioning\n\nWe try hard to keep our REST API backwards compatible, but\
    \ we occasionally have to make backwards-incompatible changes in the process of\
    \ shipping new features. These breaking changes can cause unexpected behavior\
    \ if you don't prepare for them accordingly.\n\nUpdates to our REST API include\
    \ support for the latest features in LaunchDarkly. We also release a new version\
    \ of our REST API every time we make a breaking change. We provide simultaneous\
    \ support for multiple API versions so you can migrate from your current API version\
    \ to a new version at your own pace.\n\n### Setting the API version per request\n\
    \nYou can set the API version on a specific request by sending an `LD-API-Version`\
    \ header, as shown in the example below:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: 20220603\n```\n\
    \nThe header value is the version number of the API version you would like to\
    \ request. The number for each version corresponds to the date the version was\
    \ released in `yyyymmdd` format. In the example above the version `20220603` corresponds\
    \ to June 03, 2022.\n\n### Setting the API version per access token\n\nWhen you\
    \ create an access token, you must specify a specific version of the API to use.\
    \ This ensures that integrations using this token cannot be broken by version\
    \ changes.\n\nTokens created before versioning was released have their version\
    \ set to `20160426`, which is the version of the API that existed before the current\
    \ versioning scheme, so that they continue working the same way they did before\
    \ versioning.\n\nIf you would like to upgrade your integration to use a new API\
    \ version, you can explicitly set the header described above.\n\n> ### Best practice:\
    \ Set the header for every client or integration\n>\n> We recommend that you set\
    \ the API version header explicitly in any client or integration you build.\n\
    >\n> Only rely on the access token API version during manual testing.\n\n### API\

    \nThe applications API lets you create, update, delete, and search for applications\
    \ and application versions.\n\nEach application includes information about the\
    \ app you're creating, and a set of versions of the app that you've released.\
    \ You can use applications to target particular application versions in your feature\
    \ flags more easily, and to handle unsupported application versions more gracefully.\n\
    \nIn addition to creating applications through the applications API, you can also\
    \ create applications in the LaunchDarkly user interface. To learn more, read\
    \ [Applications](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/organize/applications). LaunchDarkly\
    \ also creates applications and application versions automatically when a LaunchDarkly\
    \ SDK evaluates a feature flag for a context that includes application information.\
    \ To learn more, read [Automatic environment attributes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/environment-attributes).\n\
    \nYou can use an application in any project in your LaunchDarkly account.\n\n\
    ### Filtering applications and application versions\n\nThe `filter` parameter\
    \ supports the following operators: `equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith`.\n\
    \nYou can also combine filters in the following ways:\n\n- Use a comma (`,`) as\
    \ an AND operator\n- Use a vertical bar (`|`) as an OR operator\n- Use parentheses\
    \ (`()`) to group filters\n\n#### Supported fields and operators\n\nYou can only\
    \ filter certain fields in applications when using the `filter` parameter. Additionally,\
    \ you can only filter some fields with certain operators.\n\nWhen you search for\
    \ applications, the `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators:\n\
    \n|<div style=\"width:120px\">Field</div> |Description |Supported operators |\n\
    |---|---|---|\n|`key` | The application or application version key, a unique identifier\
    \ |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`name` | The application name or application\
    \ version name |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |\n|`autoAdded` |\
    \ Whether the application or application version was automatically created because\
    \ it was included in a context when a LaunchDarkly SDK evaluated a feature flag,\
    \ or was created through the LaunchDarkly UI or REST API |`equals`, `notEquals`\
    \ |\n|`kind` | The application kind, one of `mobile`, `server`, `browser`. Only\
    \ available for [Get applications](/tag/Applications-(beta)#operation/getApplications).\
    \ |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`supported` | Whether a mobile application\
    \ version is supported or unsupported. Only available for [Get application versions\
    \ by application key](/tag/Applications-(beta)#operation/getApplicationVersions).|`equals`,\
    \ `notEquals` |\n\nFor example, the filter `?filter=kind anyOf ['mobile', 'server']`\
    \ matches applications whose `kind` is either `mobile` or `server`. The filter\
    \ is not case-sensitive.\n\nThe documented values for `filter` query parameters\
    \ are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `[` in `?filter=kind anyOf ['mobile',\
    \ 'server']` must be encoded to `%5B`.\n\n### Sorting applications and application\
    \ versions\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the following fields for sorting:\n- `name`\
    \ sorts by application name.\n- `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the\
    \ application.\n\nBy default, the sort is in ascending order. Use `-` to sort\
    \ in descending order. For example, `?sort=name` sorts the response by application\
    \ name in ascending order, and `?sort=-name` sorts in descending order.\n"

    \ approval before you can apply it. To learn more, read [Approvals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/approvals).\n\
    \nChanges that conflict will fail if approved and applied, and the flag will not\
    \ be updated.\n\nSeveral of the endpoints in the approvals API require a flag\
    \ approval request ID. The flag approval request ID is returned as part of the\
    \ [Create approval request](/tag/Approvals#operation/postApprovalRequest) and\
    \ [List approval requests for a flag](/tag/Approvals#operation/getApprovalsForFlag)\
    \ responses. It is the `_id` field, or the `_id` field of each element in the\
    \ `items` array. If you created the approval request as part of a [workflow](/tag/Workflows),\
    \ you can also use a workflow ID as the approval request ID. The workflow ID is\
    \ returned as part of the [Create workflow](/tag/Workflows#operation/postWorkflow)\

  name: Context settings
- description: "\nContexts are people, services, machines, or other resources that\
    \ encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts are identified by their `kind`,\
    \ which describes the type of resources encountering flags, and by their `key`.\
    \ Each unique combination of one or more contexts that have encountered a feature\
    \ flag in your product is called a context instance.\n\nWhen you use the LaunchDarkly\
    \ SDK to evaluate a flag, you provide a context to that call. LaunchDarkly records\
    \ the key and attributes of each context instance. You can view these in the LaunchDarkly\
    \ user interface from the **Contexts** list, or use the Context APIs. To learn\
    \ more, read [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).\n\nLaunchDarkly\
    \ provides APIs for you to:\n\n* retrieve contexts, context instances, and context\
    \ attribute names and values\n* search for contexts or context instances\n* delete\
    \ context instances\n* fetch context kinds\n* create and update context kinds\n\
    \nTo learn more about context kinds, read [Context kinds](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts/context-kinds).\n\
    \nContexts are always scoped within a project and an environment. Each environment\
    \ has its own set of context instance records.\n\nSeveral of the endpoints in\
    \ the contexts API require a context instance ID or application ID. Both of these\
    \ IDs are returned as part of the [Search for context instances](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContextInstances)\
    \ response. The context instance ID is the `id` field of each element in the `items`\
    \ array. The application ID is the `applicationId` field of each element in the\
    \ `items` array. By default, the application ID is set to the SDK you are using.\
    \ In the LaunchDarkly UI, the application ID and application version appear on\
    \ the context details page in the \"From source\" field. You can change the application\
    \ ID as part of your SDK configuration. To learn more, read [Application metadata\
    \ configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/app-config).\n\n###\
    \ Filtering contexts and context instances\n\nWhen you [search for contexts](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContexts)\
    \ or [context instances](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContextInstances), you\
    \ can filter on certain fields using the `filter` parameter either as a query\
    \ parameter or as a request body parameter.\n\nThe `filter` parameter supports\
    \ the following operators: `after`, `anyOf`, `before`, `contains`, `equals`, `exists`,\
    \ `notEquals`, `startsWith`.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for details on operators\
    \ and syntax</summary>\n\n#### after\n\nReturns contexts or context instances\
    \ if any of the values in a field, which should be dates, are after the provided\
    \ time. For example:\n\n* `myField after \"2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00\"`\n\n####\
    \ anyOf\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field\
    \ match any of the values in the match value. For example:\n\n* `myField anyOf\
    \ [44]`\n* `myField anyOf [\"phone\",\"tablet\"]`\n* `myField anyOf [true]\"`\n\
    \n#### before\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if any of the values in\
    \ a field, which should be dates, are before the provided time. For example:\n\
    \n* `myField before \"2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00\"`\n\n#### contains\n\nReturns\
    \ contexts or context instances if all the match values are found in the list\
    \ of values in this field. For example:\n\n* `myListField contains 44`\n* `myListField\
    \ contains [\"phone\",\"tablet\"]`\n* `myListField contains true`\n\n#### equals\n\
    \nReturns contexts or context instances if there is an exact match on the entire\
    \ field. For example:\n\n* `myField equals 44`\n* `myField equals \"device\"`\n\
    * `myField equals true`\n* `myField equals [1,2,3,4]`\n* `myField equals [\"hello\"\
    ,\"goodbye\"]`\n\n#### exists\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if the\
    \ field matches the specified existence. For example:\n\n* `myField exists true`\n\
    * `myField exists false`\n* `*.name exists true`\n\n#### notEquals\n\nReturns\
    \ contexts or context instances if there is not an exact match on the entire field.\
    \ For example:\n\n* `myField notEquals 44`\n* `myField notEquals \"device\"`\n\
    * `myField notEquals true`\n* `myField notEquals [1,2,3,4]`\n* `myField notEquals\
    \ [\"hello\",\"goodbye\"]`\n\n#### startsWith\n\nReturns contexts or context instances\
    \ if the value in a field, which should be a singular string, begins with the\
    \ provided substring. For example:\n\n* `myField startsWith \"do\"`\n\n</details>\n\
    \nYou can also combine filters in the following ways:\n\n* Use a comma (`,`) as\
    \ an AND operator\n* Use a vertical bar (`|`) as an OR operator\n* Use parentheses\
    \ `()` to group filters\n\nFor example:\n\n* `myField notEquals 0, myField notEquals\
    \ 1` returns contexts or context instances where `myField` is not 0 and is not\
    \ 1\n* `myFirstField equals \"device\",(mySecondField equals \"iPhone\"|mySecondField\
    \ equals \"iPad\")` returns contexts or context instances where `myFirstField`\
    \ is equal to \"device\" and `mySecondField` is equal to either \"iPhone\" or\
    \ \"iPad\"\n\n#### Supported fields and operators\n\nYou can only filter certain\
    \ fields in contexts and context instances when using the `filter` parameter.\
    \ Additionally, you can only filter some fields with certain operators.\n\nWhen\
    \ you search for [contexts]((/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContexts)), the `filter`\
    \ parameter supports the following fields and operators:\n\n|<div style=\"width:120px\"\

    \ a literal attribute name or a JSON path to specify the attribute. If you use\
    \ a JSON path, then you must escape the `/` character, using `~1`, and the `~`\
    \ character, using `~0`. For example, use `user.job/title` or `user./job~1title`\

    \n## Anatomy of a feature flag\n\nThis section describes the sample feature flag\
    \ representation in more detail.\n\n### Top-level attributes\n\nMost of the top-level\
    \ attributes have a straightforward interpretation, for example `name` and `description`.\n\
    \nThe `variations` array represents the different variation values that a feature\
    \ flag has. For a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and `false`.\
    \ Multivariate flags have more variation values, and those values could be any\
    \ JSON type: numbers, strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting rules, the variations\
    \ are referred to by their index into this array.\n\nTo update these attributes,\
    \ read [Update feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag), especially the instructions\
    \ for **updating flag settings**.\n\n### Per-environment configurations\n\nEach\
    \ entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object that represents the environment-specific\
    \ flag configuration data available in the flag's Targeting tab. To learn more,\
    \ read [Targeting with flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags).\n\
    \nTo update per-environment information for a flag, read [Update feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag),\
    \ especially the instructions for **turning flags on and off** and **working with\
    \ targeting and variations**.\n\n### Individual context targets\n\nThe `targets`\
    \ and `contextTargets` arrays in the per-environment configuration data correspond\
    \ to the individual context targeting on the Targeting tab. To learn more, read\
    \ [Individual targeting](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/individual-targeting).\n\
    \nEach object in the `targets` and `contextTargets` arrays represents a list of\
    \ context keys assigned to a particular variation. The `targets` array includes\
    \ contexts with `contextKind` of \"user\" and the `contextTargets` array includes\
    \ contexts with context kinds other than \"user.\"\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n\
    {\n  ...\n  \"environments\" : {\n    \"production\" : {\n      ...\n      \"\
    targets\": [\n        {\n          \"values\": [\"user-key-123abc\"],\n      \
    \    \"variation\": 0,\n          \"contextKind\": \"user\"\n        }\n     \
    \ ],\n      \"contextTargets\": [\n        {\n          \"values\": [\"org-key-123abc\"\
    ],\n          \"variation\": 0,\n          \"contextKind\": \"organization\"\n\
    \        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `targets` array means that any\
    \ user context instance with the key `user-key-123abc` receives the first variation\
    \ listed in the `variations` array. The `contextTargets` array means that any\
    \ organization context with the key `org-key-123abc` receives the first variation\
    \ listed in the `variations` array. Recall that the variations are stored at the\
    \ top level of the flag JSON in an array, and the per-environment configuration\
    \ rules point to indexes into this array. If this is a boolean flag, both contexts\
    \ are receiving the `true` variation.\n\n### Targeting rules\n\nThe `rules` array\
    \ corresponds to the rules section of the Targeting tab. This is where you can\
    \ express complex rules on attributes with conditions and operators. For example,\
    \ you might create a rule that specifies \"roll out the `true` variation to 80%\
    \ of contexts whose email address ends with `gmail.com`\". To learn more, read\
    \ [Creating targeting rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/targeting-rules#creating-targeting-rules).\n\
    \n### The fallthrough rule\n\nThe `fallthrough` object is a special rule that\
    \ contains no conditions. It is the rollout strategy that is applied when none\
    \ of the individual or custom targeting rules match. In the LaunchDarkly UI, it\
    \ is called the \"Default rule.\"\n\n### The off variation\n\nThe off variation\
    \ represents the variation to serve if the feature flag targeting is turned off,\
    \ meaning the `on` attribute is `false`. For boolean flags, this is usually `false`.\
    \ For multivariate flags, set the off variation to whatever variation represents\
    \ the control or baseline behavior for your application. If you don't set the\
    \ off variation, LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.\n\
    \n### Percentage rollouts\n\nWhen you work with targeting rules and with the default\
    \ rule, you can specify either a single variation or a percentage rollout. The\
    \ `weight` attribute defines the percentage rollout for each variation. Weights\
    \ range from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout). The weights are scaled\
    \ by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can be represented without\
    \ using floating-point. For example, a weight of `60000` means that 60% of contexts\
    \ will receive that variation. The sum of weights across all variations should\
    \ be 100%.\n"

    \ HTTP POST payload to the webhook's URL. Use webhooks to update external issue\

    \ and more.\n\nSeveral of the endpoints in the webhooks API require a webhook\
    \ ID. The webhook ID is returned as part of the [Creates a webhook](/tag/Webhooks#operation/postWebhook)\

    \ webhook\n\nOptionally, you can define a `secret` when you create a webhook.\
    \ If you define the secret, the webhook `POST` request will include an `X-LD-Signature\
    \ header`, whose value will contain an HMAC SHA256 hex digest of the webhook payload,\
    \ using the `secret` as the key.\n\nCompute the signature of the payload using\
    \ the same shared secret in your code to verify that the webhook was triggered\
    \ by LaunchDarkly.\n\n## Understanding connection retries\n\nIf LaunchDarkly receives\
    \ a non-`2xx` response to a webhook `POST`, it will retry the delivery one time.\
    \ Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If you build an integration on webhooks,\
    \ make sure it is tolerant of delivery failures.\n"

    \ our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact\
    \ Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).\n\nWorkflow templates allow\
    \ you to define a set of workflow stages that you can use as a starting point\
    \ for new workflows. You can create these workflows for any flag in any environment\
    \ and any project, and you can create as many workflows as you like from a given\
    \ template.\n\nYou can create workflow templates in two ways:\n* by specifying\
    \ the desired stages, using the `stages` property of the request body\n* by specifying\
    \ an existing workflow to save as a template, using the `workflowId` property\
    \ of the request body\n\nYou can use templates to create a workflow in any project,\
    \ environment, or flag. However, when you create a template, you must specify\
    \ a particular project, environment, and flag. This means that when you create\
    \ a template using the `stages` property, you must also include `projectKey`,\
    \ `environmentKey`, and `flagKey` properties in the request body. When you create\
    \ a template from an existing workflow, it will use the project, environment,\
    \ and flag of the existing workflow, so those properties can be omitted from the\
    \ request body.\n\nTo learn more, read [Workflows documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows)\

    \ at different stages of a workflow. To learn more, read [Workflows](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows).\n\
    \nThe actions supported are as follows:\n\n- Turning targeting `ON` or `OFF`\n\

    \ a rule to target by segment\n- Modifying the rollout percentage for rules\n\n\

        \ in the specified list. For example: `filter=notifyMemberIds anyOf [\"memberId1\"\

        \ equals 457034721476302714390214`.\n- `resourceId` filters for only approvals\
        \ that correspond to the the specified resource identifier. For example: `filter=resourceId\
        \ equals proj/my-project:env/my-environment:flag/my-flag`.\n- `reviewStatus`\
        \ filters for only approvals which correspond to the review status in the\

        \ and `completed`. For example: `filter=status anyOf [\"pending\", \"scheduled\"\
        ]`.\n\nYou can also apply multiple filters at once. For example, setting `filter=projectKey\
        \ equals my-project, reviewStatus anyOf [\"pending\",\"approved\"]` matches\
        \ approval requests which correspond to the `my-project` project key, and\
        \ a review status of either `pending` or `approved`.\n\n### Expanding approval\
        \ response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional\
        \ fields in the response, with the following fields:\n\n- `flag` includes\
        \ the flag the approval request belongs to\n- `project` includes the project\
        \ the approval request belongs to\n- `environments` includes the environments\

        \ availability is set to use the client-side ID. Using `mobile` filters to\
        \ flags set to use the mobile key. Using `anyClient` filters to flags set\
        \ to use either the client-side ID or the mobile key. Using `server` filters\
        \ to flags set to use neither, that is, to flags only available in server-side\
        \ SDKs.  | `filter=sdkAvailability:client` |\n| `segmentTargeted`       |\
        \ A string. It filters the list to flags that target the segment with this\
        \ key. This filter requires the `filterEnv` filter. | `filter=segmentTargeted:example-segment-key,filterEnv:production`\
        \ |\n| `status`                | A string, either `new`, `inactive`, `active`,\
        \ or `launched`. It filters the list to flags with the specified status in\
        \ the specified environment. This filter requires the `filterEnv` filter.\
        \ | `filter=status:active,filterEnv:production` |\n| `tags`              \
        \    | A `+`-separated list of tags. It filters the list to flags that have\
        \ all of the tags in the list. | `filter=tags:beta+test` |\n| `type`     \
        \             | A string, either `temporary` or `permanent`. It filters the\
        \ list to flags with the specified type. | `filter=type:permanent` |\n\nThe\
        \ documented values for the `filter` query are prior to URL encoding. For\
        \ example, the `+` in `filter=tags:beta+test` must be encoded to `%2B`.\n\n\
        By default, this endpoint returns all flags. You can page through the list\
        \ with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`,\
        \ and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links will not be\
        \ present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first`\
        \ and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.\n\n\
        ### Sorting flags\n\nYou can sort flags based on the following fields:\n\n\
        - `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the flag.\n- `key` sorts by\
        \ the key of the flag.\n- `maintainerId` sorts by the flag maintainer.\n-\
        \ `name` sorts by flag name.\n- `tags` sorts by tags.\n- `targetingModifiedDate`\
        \ sorts by the date that the flag's targeting rules were last modified in\
        \ a given environment. It must be used with `env` parameter and it can not\
        \ be combined with any other sort. If multiple `env` values are provided,\
        \ it will perform sort using the first one. For example, `sort=-targetingModifiedDate&env=production&env=staging`\
        \ returns results sorted by `targetingModifiedDate` for the `production` environment.\n\
        - `type` sorts by flag type\n\nAll fields are sorted in ascending order by\
        \ default. To sort in descending order, prefix the field with a dash ( - ).\
        \ For example, `sort=-name` sorts the response by flag name in descending\
        \ order.\n\n### Expanding response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query\
        \ param to include additional fields in the response, with the following fields:\n\
        \n- `codeReferences` includes code references for the feature flag\n- `evaluation`\
        \ includes evaluation information within returned environments, including\
        \ which context kinds the flag has been evaluated for in the past 30 days\n\
        - `migrationSettings` includes migration settings information within the flag\
        \ and within returned environments. These settings are only included for migration\
        \ flags, that is, where `purpose` is `migration`.\n\nFor example, `expand=evaluation`\
        \ includes the `evaluation` field in the response.\n\n### Migration flags\n\
        For migration flags, the cohort information is included in the `rules` property\
        \ of a flag's response, and default cohort information is included in the\
        \ `fallthrough` property of a flag's response.\nTo learn more, read [Migration\
        \ Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).\n"

      description: "Perform a partial update to a feature flag. The request body must\
        \ be a valid semantic patch, JSON patch, or JSON merge patch. To learn more\
        \ the different formats, read [Updates](/#section/Overview/Updates).\n\n###\
        \ Using semantic patches on a feature flag\n\nTo make a semantic patch request,\
        \ you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type`\
        \ header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\
        \nThe body of a semantic patch request for updating feature flags takes the\
        \ following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description\
        \ of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some instructions\
        \ only) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.\n* `instructions` (array):\
        \ (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the\
        \ list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction.\
        \ If the action requires parameters, you must include those parameters as\
        \ additional fields in the object. The body of a single semantic patch can\
        \ contain many different instructions.\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch\
        \ requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating feature\
        \ flags.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>turning\
        \ flags on and off</strong></summary>\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey`\
        \ parameter.\n\n#### turnFlagOff\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **Off**.\n\
        \nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\"\
        ,\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnFlagOn\n\
        \nSets the flag's targeting state to **On**.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\":\
        \ [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n</details><br />\n\n<details>\n\
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>working with targeting and\
        \ variations</strong></summary>\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey`\
        \ parameter.\n\nSeveral of the instructions for working with targeting and\
        \ variations require flag rule IDs, variation IDs, or clause IDs as parameters.\
        \ Each of these are returned as part of the [Get feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/getFeatureFlag)\
        \ response. The flag rule ID is the `_id` field of each element in the `rules`\
        \ array within each environment listed in the `environments` object. The variation\
        \ ID is the `_id` field in each element of the `variations` array. The clause\
        \ ID is the `_id` field of each element of the `clauses` array within the\
        \ `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object.\n\
        \n#### addClauses\n\nAdds the given clauses to the rule indicated by `ruleId`.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauses`:\
        \ Array of clause objects, with `contextKind` (string), `attribute` (string),\
        \ `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers,\
        \ or dates) properties. The `contextKind`, `attribute`, and `values` are case\
        \ sensitive. The `op` must be lower-case.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n\t\"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n\t\"instructions\":\
        \ [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addClauses\",\n\t\t\"ruleId\": \"a902ef4a-2faf-4eaf-88e1-ecc356708a29\"\
        ,\n\t\t\"clauses\": [{\n\t\t\t\"contextKind\": \"user\",\n\t\t\t\"attribute\"\
        : \"country\",\n\t\t\t\"op\": \"in\",\n\t\t\t\"negate\": false,\n\t\t\t\"\
        values\": [\"USA\", \"Canada\"]\n\t\t}]\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addPrerequisite\n\
        \nAdds the flag indicated by `key` with variation `variationId` as a prerequisite\
        \ to the flag in the path parameter.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `key`: Flag\
        \ key of the prerequisite flag.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation of the\
        \ prerequisite flag.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"environmentKey\"\

        \n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addRule\n\nAdds a new targeting rule to the flag. The\
        \ rule may contain `clauses` and serve the variation that `variationId` indicates,\
        \ or serve a percentage rollout that `rolloutWeights`, `rolloutBucketBy`,\
        \ and `rolloutContextKind` indicate.\n\nIf you set `beforeRuleId`, this adds\
        \ the new rule before the indicated rule. Otherwise, adds the new rule to\
        \ the end of the list.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `clauses`: Array of clause\
        \ objects, with `contextKind` (string), `attribute` (string), `op` (string),\
        \ `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers, or dates) properties.\
        \ The `contextKind`, `attribute`, and `values` are case sensitive. The `op`\
        \ must be lower-case.\n- `beforeRuleId`: (Optional) ID of a flag rule.\n-\
        \ Either\n  - `variationId`: ID of a variation of the flag.\n\n  or\n\n  -\

        \ of a percent (0-100000).\n  - `rolloutBucketBy`: (Optional) Context attribute\
        \ available in the specified `rolloutContextKind`.\n  - `rolloutContextKind`:\
        \ (Optional) Context kind, defaults to `user`\n\nHere's an example that uses\
        \ a `variationId`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\"\
        ,\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addRule\",\n    \"variationId\"\
        : \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\",\n    \"clauses\": [{\n      \"\
        contextKind\": \"organization\",\n      \"attribute\": \"located_in\",\n \
        \     \"op\": \"in\",\n      \"negate\": false,\n      \"values\": [\"Sweden\"\
        , \"Norway\"]\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nHere's an example that uses a percentage\
        \ rollout:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\"\
        ,\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addRule\",\n    \"clauses\": [{\n\
        \      \"contextKind\": \"organization\",\n      \"attribute\": \"located_in\"\
        ,\n      \"op\": \"in\",\n      \"negate\": false,\n      \"values\": [\"\
        Sweden\", \"Norway\"]\n    }],\n    \"rolloutContextKind\": \"organization\"\
        ,\n    \"rolloutWeights\": {\n      \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\"\
        : 15000, // serve 15% this variation\n      \"e5830889-1ec5-4b0c-9cc9-c48790090c43\"\
        : 85000  // serve 85% this variation\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addTargets\n\
        \nAdds context keys to the individual context targets for the context kind\
        \ that `contextKind` specifies and the variation that `variationId` specifies.\
        \ Returns an error if this causes the flag to target the same context key\
        \ in multiple variations.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of context\
        \ keys.\n- `contextKind`: (Optional) Context kind to target, defaults to `user`\n\

        : [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addTargets\",\n\t\t\"values\": [\"context-key-123abc\"\
        , \"context-key-456def\"],\n\t\t\"variationId\": \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\"\
        \n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addUserTargets\n\nAdds user keys to the individual\
        \ user targets for the variation that `variationId` specifies. Returns an\
        \ error if this causes the flag to target the same user key in multiple variations.\
        \ If you are working with contexts, use `addTargets` instead of this instruction.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n- `variationId`: ID\
        \ of a variation on the flag.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"environmentKey\"\

        \ If you're using a client-side or mobile SDK, you must expose your feature\
        \ flags in order for the client-side or mobile SDKs to evaluate them.\n\n\
        ##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Use \"usingMobileKey\" to turn off availability\
        \ for mobile SDKs. Use \"usingEnvironmentId\" to turn on availability for\
        \ client-side SDKs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\"\
        : [ { \"kind\": \"turnOffClientSideAvailability\", \"value\": \"usingMobileKey\"\
        \ } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnOnClientSideAvailability\n\nTurns on client-side\
        \ SDK availability for the flag. This is equivalent to unchecking the **SDKs\
        \ using Mobile Key** and/or **SDKs using client-side ID** boxes for the flag.\
        \ If you're using a client-side or mobile SDK, you must expose your feature\
        \ flags in order for the client-side or mobile SDKs to evaluate them.\n\n\
        ##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Use \"usingMobileKey\" to turn on availability\
        \ for mobile SDKs. Use \"usingEnvironmentId\" to turn on availability for\
        \ client-side SDKs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\"\
        : [ { \"kind\": \"turnOnClientSideAvailability\", \"value\": \"usingMobileKey\"\
        \ } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateDescription\n\nUpdates the feature flag description.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new description.\n\nHere's an example:\n\
        \n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateDescription\", \"\
        value\": \"Updated flag description\" } ]\n}\n```\n#### updateMaintainerMember\n\
        \nUpdates the maintainer of the flag to an existing member and removes the\
        \ existing maintainer.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The ID of the member.\n\
        \nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateMaintainerMember\"\
        , \"value\": \"61e9b714fd47591727db558a\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateMaintainerTeam\n\
        \nUpdates the maintainer of the flag to an existing team and removes the existing\
        \ maintainer.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The key of the team.\n\nHere's\
        \ an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateMaintainerTeam\"\
        , \"value\": \"example-team-key\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates\
        \ the feature flag name.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new name.\n\
        \nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateName\"\
        , \"value\": \"Updated flag name\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n</details><br />\n\n<details>\n\
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating the flag lifecycle</strong></summary>\n\
        \nThese instructions do not require the `environmentKey` parameter. They make\
        \ changes that apply to the flag across all environments.\n\n#### archiveFlag\n\
        \nArchives the feature flag. This retires it from LaunchDarkly without deleting\
        \ it. You cannot archive a flag that is a prerequisite of other flags.\n\n\
        ```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"archiveFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\
        \n#### deleteFlag\n\nDeletes the feature flag and its rules. You cannot restore\
        \ a deleted flag. If this flag is requested again, the flag value defined\
        \ in code will be returned for all contexts.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"deleteFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### deprecateFlag\n\
        \nDeprecates the feature flag. This hides it from the live flags list without\
        \ archiving or deleting it.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\"\
        : [ { \"kind\": \"deprecateFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### restoreDeprecatedFlag\n\
        \nRestores the feature flag if it was previously deprecated.\n\nHere's an\
        \ example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"restoreDeprecatedFlag\"\
        \ } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### restoreFlag\n\nRestores the feature flag if it was previously\
        \ archived.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"\
        kind\": \"restoreFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Using JSON patches\
        \ on a feature flag\n\nIf you do not include the semantic patch header described\
        \ above, you can use a [JSON patch](/reference#updates-using-json-patch) or\
        \ [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) representation\
        \ of the desired changes.\n\nIn the JSON patch representation, use a JSON\
        \ pointer in the `path` element to describe what field to change. Use the\
        \ [Get feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/getFeatureFlag) endpoint\
        \ to find the field you want to update.\n\nThere are a few special cases to\
        \ keep in mind when determining the value of the `path` element:\n\n  * To\
        \ add an individual target to a specific variation if the flag variation already\
        \ has individual targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n\
        \  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/0/values/-\"\
        ,\n      \"value\": \"TestClient10\"\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add an individual\
        \ target to a specific variation if the flag variation does not already have\
        \ individual targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n\
        \  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/-\"\
        ,\n      \"value\": { \"variation\": 0, \"values\": [\"TestClient10\"] }\n\
        \    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add a flag to a release pipeline, the path for\
        \ the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"\
        add\",\n      \"path\": \"/releasePipelineKey\",\n      \"value\": \"example-release-pipeline-key\"\
        \n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Required approvals\nIf a request attempts to alter\
        \ a flag configuration in an environment where approvals are required for\
        \ the flag, the request will fail with a 405. Changes to the flag configuration\
        \ in that environment will require creating an [approval request](/tag/Approvals)\
        \ or a [workflow](/tag/Workflows).\n\n### Conflicts\nIf a flag configuration\
        \ change made through this endpoint would cause a pending scheduled change\
        \ or approval request to fail, this endpoint will return a 400. You can ignore\
        \ this check by adding an `ignoreConflicts` query parameter set to `true`.\n\
        \n### Migration flags\nFor migration flags, the cohort information is included\
        \ in the `rules` property of a flag's response. You can update cohorts by\
        \ updating `rules`. Default cohort information is included in the `fallthrough`\
        \ property of a flag's response. You can update the default cohort by updating\
        \ `fallthrough`.\nWhen you update the rollout for a cohort or the default\
        \ cohort through the API, provide a rollout instead of a single `variationId`.\n\

    patch:
      description: "Schedule a context for removal from individual targeting on a\
        \ feature flag. The flag must already individually target the context.\n\n\
        You can add, update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only schedule\
        \ a context for removal on a single variation per flag.\n\nUpdating an expiring\
        \ target uses the semantic patch format. To make a semantic patch request,\
        \ you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type`\
        \ header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\
        \n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind`\
        \ instructions for updating expiring targets.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click\
        \ to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring targets</strong></summary>\n\
        \n#### addExpiringTarget\n\nAdds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove\
        \ the context from the flag's individual targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n\
        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove\
        \ the context from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`: ID\
        \ of a variation on the flag\n* `contextKey`: The context key for the context\
        \ to remove from individual targeting\n* `contextKind`: The kind of context\
        \ represented by the `contextKey`\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"\
        instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addExpiringTarget\",\n    \"value\": 1754006460000,\n\

        : \"user-key-123abc\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"user\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n####\
        \ updateExpiringTarget\n\nUpdates the date and time that LaunchDarkly will\
        \ remove the context from the flag's individual targeting\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove\
        \ the context from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`: ID\
        \ of a variation on the flag\n* `contextKey`: The context key for the context\
        \ to remove from individual targeting\n* `contextKind`: The kind of context\
        \ represented by the `contextKey`\n* `version`: (Optional) The version of\
        \ the expiring target to update. If included, update will fail if version\
        \ doesn't match current version of the expiring target.\n\nHere's an example:\n\
        \n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"updateExpiringTarget\"\
        ,\n    \"value\": 1754006460000,\n    \"variationId\": \"4254742c-71ae-411f-a992-43b18a51afe0\"\
        ,\n    \"contextKey\": \"user-key-123abc\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"user\"\
        \n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeExpiringTarget\n\nRemoves the scheduled removal\
        \ of the context from the flag's individual targeting. The context will remain\
        \ part of the flag's individual targeting until you explicitly remove it,\
        \ or until you schedule another removal.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `variationId`:\
        \ ID of a variation on the flag\n* `contextKey`: The context key for the context\
        \ to remove from individual targeting\n* `contextKind`: The kind of context\

      description: "Update a flag trigger. Updating a flag trigger uses the semantic\
        \ patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating\
        \ flag triggers.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating\
        \ flag triggers</strong></summary>\n\n#### replaceTriggerActionInstructions\n\
        \nRemoves the existing trigger action and replaces it with the new instructions.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: An array of the new `kind`s of actions to\
        \ perform when triggering. Supported flag actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.\n\
        \nHere's an example that replaces the existing action with new instructions\
        \ to turn flag targeting off:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [\n    {\n\
        \      \"kind\": \"replaceTriggerActionInstructions\",\n      \"value\": [\
        \ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\"} ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### cycleTriggerUrl\n\
        \nGenerates a new URL for this trigger. You must update any clients using\
        \ the trigger to use this new URL.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n \
        \ \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"cycleTriggerUrl\" }]\n}\n```\n\n#### disableTrigger\n\
        \nDisables the trigger. This saves the trigger configuration, but the trigger\
        \ stops running. To re-enable, use `enableTrigger`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\
        \n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"disableTrigger\" }]\n}\n\
        ```\n\n#### enableTrigger\n\nEnables the trigger. If you previously disabled\
        \ the trigger, it begins running again.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"enableTrigger\" }]\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n"

      description: "\nCreate a persistent store integration.\n\nIf you are using server-side\
        \ SDKs, segments synced from external tools and larger list-based segments\
        \ require a persistent store within your infrastructure. LaunchDarkly keeps\
        \ the persistent store up to date and consults it during flag evaluation.\n\
        \nYou can use either Redis or DynamoDB as your persistent store. When you\
        \ create a persistent store integration, the fields in the `config` object\
        \ in the request vary depending on which persistent store you use.\n\nIf you\
        \ are using Redis to create your persistent store integration, you will need\
        \ to know:\n\n* Your Redis host\n* Your Redis port\n* Your Redis username\n\
        * Your Redis password\n* Whether or not LaunchDarkly should connect using\
        \ TLS\n\nIf you are using DynamoDB to create your persistent store integration,\
        \ you will need to know:\n\n* Your DynamoDB table name. The table must have\
        \ the following schema:\n  * Partition key: `namespace` (string)\n  * Sort\
        \ key: `key` (string)\n* Your DynamoDB Amazon Web Services (AWS) region.\n\
        * Your AWS role Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This is the role that LaunchDarkly\
        \ will assume to manage your DynamoDB table.\n* The External ID you specified\
        \ when creating your Amazon Resource Name (ARN).\n\nTo learn more, read [Segment\
        \ configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments/big-segment-configuration).\n"

    get:
      description: "Return a list of account members.\n\nBy default, this returns\
        \ the first 20 members. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter\
        \ and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned\
        \ `_links` field. These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't\
        \ exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the\
        \ response on the first page.\n\n### Filtering members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports\
        \ the following fields for filters:\n\n- `query` is a string that matches\
        \ against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `role`\
        \ is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. It filters the list to\
        \ members who have any of the roles in the list. For the purposes of this\
        \ filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.\n- `team` is a string that matches\
        \ against the key of the teams the members belong to. It is not case sensitive.\n\
        - `noteam` is a boolean that filters the list of members who are not on a\
        \ team if true and members on a team if false.\n- `lastSeen` is a JSON object\
        \ in one of the following formats:\n  - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that\
        \ have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation\
        \ to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.\n\
        \  - `{\"noData\": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly\
        \ began recording last seen timestamps.\n  - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}`\
        \ - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should\
        \ be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.\n- `accessCheck` is a string\
        \ that represents a specific action on a specific resource and is in the format\
        \ `<ActionSpecifier>:<ResourceSpecifier>`. It filters the list to members\
        \ who have the ability to perform that action on that resource. Note: `accessCheck`\
        \ is only supported in API version `20220603` and earlier. To learn more,\
        \ read [Versioning](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/#section/Overview/Versioning).\n\
        \  - For example, the filter `accessCheck:createApprovalRequest:proj/default:env/test:flag/alternate-page`\
        \ matches members with the ability to create an approval request for the `alternate-page`\
        \ flag in the `test` environment of the `default` project.\n  - Wildcard and\
        \ tag filters are not supported when filtering for access.\n\nFor example,\
        \ the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole` matches members with the string\
        \ `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case, who also are either an `Owner`\
        \ or `Admin` or have the custom role `customrole`.\n\n### Sorting members\n\
        \nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName` and `lastSeen`:\n\
        \n- `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the member's email if\
        \ no name is set.\n- `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen` property. LaunchDarkly\
        \ considers members that have never been seen or have no data the oldest.\n"

        \nTo update fields in the account member object that are arrays, set the `path`\

        \ to the beginning of the array. Use `/-` to add to the end of the array.\
        \ For example, to add a new custom role to a member, use the following request\
        \ body:\n\n```\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/customRoles/0\"\

        \ update their own names and email addresses though the LaunchDarkly UI.\n\
        \nWhen SAML SSO or SCIM is enabled for the account, account members are managed\

        \ the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that\
        \ returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist.\
        \ For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response\

        \ to the first page when you are already on the first page.\n\n### Filtering\
        \ projects\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:\n- `query` is\
        \ a string that matches against the projects' names and keys. It is not case\
        \ sensitive.\n- `tags` is a `+`-separated list of project tags. It filters\
        \ the list of projects that have all of the tags in the list.\n\nFor example,\
        \ the filter `filter=query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches projects with the\
        \ string `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`.\
        \ The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\nThe documented values for `filter`\
        \ query parameters are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2`\
        \ must be encoded to `%2B`.\n\n### Sorting projects\n\nLaunchDarkly supports\
        \ two fields for sorting:\n- `name` sorts by project name.\n- `createdOn`\
        \ sorts by the creation date of the project.\n\nFor example, `sort=name` sorts\
        \ the response by project name in ascending order.\n\n### Expanding the projects\
        \ response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the \"List projects\"\
        \ response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\
        \nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated\
        \ list with the `environments` field.\n\n`Environments` includes a paginated\
        \ list of the project environments.\n* `environments` includes a paginated\
        \ list of the project environments.\n\nFor example, `expand=environments`\
        \ includes the `environments` field for each project in the response.\n"

        \ matches environments with the string `abc` in their name or key and also\
        \ are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\
        \nThe documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL encoding.\
        \ For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2` must be encoded to `%2B`.\n\
        \n### Sorting environments\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the following fields for\
        \ sorting:\n\n- `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the environment.\n\
        - `critical` sorts by whether the environments are marked as critical.\n-\
        \ `name` sorts by environment name.\n\nFor example, `sort=name` sorts the\

        \ filters for experiments for the given flag key and the given metric key\

    patch:
      description: "Update an experiment. Updating an experiment uses the semantic\
        \ patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating\
        \ experiments.\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates the experiment name.\n\n#####\
        \ Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new name.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"updateName\",\n    \"value\": \"\
        Example updated experiment name\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateDescription\n\
        \nUpdates the experiment description.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The\
        \ new description.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\"\
        : [{\n    \"kind\": \"updateDescription\",\n    \"value\": \"Example updated\
        \ description\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### startIteration\n\nStarts a new iteration\
        \ for this experiment. You must [create a new iteration](/tag/Experiments-(beta)#operation/createIteration)\
        \ before calling this instruction.\n\nAn iteration may not be started until\
        \ it meets the following criteria:\n\n* Its associated flag is toggled on\
        \ and is not archived\n* Its `randomizationUnit` is set\n* At least one of\
        \ its `treatments` has a non-zero `allocationPercent`\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n- `changeJustification`: The reason for starting a new iteration. Required\
        \ when you call `startIteration` on an already running experiment, otherwise\
        \ optional.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n\
        \    \"kind\": \"startIteration\",\n    \"changeJustification\": \"It's time\
        \ to start a new iteration\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### stopIteration\n\nStops\
        \ the current iteration for this experiment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `winningTreatmentId`:\
        \ The ID of the winning treatment. Treatment IDs are returned as part of the\
        \ [Get experiment](/tag/Experiments-(beta)#operation/getExperiment) response.\
        \ They are the `_id` of each element in the `treatments` array.\n- `winningReason`:\
        \ The reason for the winner\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\"\
        : [{\n    \"kind\": \"stopIteration\",\n    \"winningTreatmentId\": \"3a548ec2-72ac-4e59-8518-5c24f5609ccf\"\
        ,\n    \"winningReason\": \"Example reason to stop the iteration\"\n  }]\n\
        }\n```\n\n#### archiveExperiment\n\nArchives this experiment. Archived experiments\
        \ are hidden by default in the LaunchDarkly user interface. You cannot start\
        \ new iterations for archived experiments.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"archiveExperiment\" }]\n}\n```\n\n####\
        \ restoreExperiment\n\nRestores an archived experiment. After restoring an\
        \ experiment, you can start new iterations for it again.\n\nHere's an example:\n\
        \n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"restoreExperiment\" }]\n\
        }\n```\n"

        \ The LaunchDarkly SDKs are specialized for the tasks of evaluating feature\
        \ flags in your application at scale and generating analytics events based\
        \ on those evaluations. This API is not designed for that use case. Any evaluations\
        \ you perform with this API will not be reflected in features such as flag\

        \ have all of the tags in the list. For example: `filter=tags contains [\"\

      description: "Create a workflow for a feature flag. You can create a workflow\
        \ directly, or you can apply a template to create a new workflow.\n\n### Creating\
        \ a workflow\n\nYou can use the create workflow endpoint to create a workflow\
        \ directly by adding a `stages` array to the request body.\n\nFor each stage,\
        \ define the `name`, `conditions` when the stage should be executed, and `action`\
        \ that describes the stage.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand example</summary>\n\
        \n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Progressive rollout starting\
        \ in two days\",\n  \"description\": \"Turn flag targeting on and increase\
        \ feature rollout in 10% increments each day\",\n  \"stages\": [\n    {\n\
        \      \"name\": \"10% rollout on day 1\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n    \
        \    {\n          \"kind\": \"schedule\",\n          \"scheduleKind\": \"\
        relative\", // or \"absolute\"\n              //  If \"scheduleKind\" is \"\
        absolute\", set \"executionDate\";\n              // \"waitDuration\" and\
        \ \"waitDurationUnit\" will be ignored\n          \"waitDuration\": 2,\n \
        \         \"waitDurationUnit\": \"calendarDay\"\n        },\n        {\n \
        \         \"kind\": \"ld-approval\",\n          \"notifyMemberIds\": [ \"\
        507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ],\n          \"notifyTeamKeys\": [ \"team-key-123abc\"\
        \ ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"action\": {\n        \"instructions\": [\n\
        \          {\n            \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"\n          },\n       \
        \   {\n            \"kind\": \"updateFallthroughVariationOrRollout\",\n  \
        \          \"rolloutWeights\": {\n              \"452f5fb5-7320-4ba3-81a1-8f4324f79d49\"\
        : 90000,\n              \"fc15f6a4-05d3-4aa4-a997-446be461345d\": 10000\n\
        \            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n</details>\n\
        \n### Creating a workflow by applying a workflow template\n\nYou can also\
        \ create a workflow by applying a workflow template. If you pass a valid workflow\
        \ template key as the `templateKey` query parameter with the request, the\
        \ API will attempt to create a new workflow with the stages defined in the\
        \ workflow template with the corresponding key.\n\n#### Applicability of stages\n\
        Templates are created in the context of a particular flag in a particular\
        \ environment in a particular project. However, because workflows created\
        \ from a template can be applied to any project, environment, and flag, some\
        \ steps of the workflow may need to be updated in order to be applicable for\
        \ the target resource.\n\nYou can pass a `dryRun` query parameter to tell\
        \ the API to return a report of which steps of the workflow template are applicable\
        \ in the target project/environment/flag, and which will need to be updated.\
        \ When the `dryRun` query parameter is present the response body includes\
        \ a `meta` property that holds a list of parameters that could potentially\
        \ be inapplicable for the target resource. Each of these parameters will include\
        \ a `valid` field. You will need to update any invalid parameters in order\
        \ to create the new workflow. You can do this using the `parameters` property,\
        \ which overrides the workflow template parameters.\n\n#### Overriding template\
        \ parameters\nYou can use the `parameters` property in the request body to\
        \ tell the API to override the specified workflow template parameters with\
        \ new values that are specific to your target project/environment/flag.\n\n\
        <details>\n<summary>Click to expand example</summary>\n\n_Example request\
        \ body_\n```json\n{\n\t\"name\": \"workflow created from my-template\",\n\t\
        \"description\": \"description of my workflow\",\n\t\"parameters\": [\n\t\t\
        {\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3b\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/clauses/0/values\"\
        ,\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": [\"updated-segment\"]\n\t\t\t\
        }\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3d\",\n\t\t\t\"path\"\
        : \"/variationId\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd12\"\
        \n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nIf there are any steps in the\
        \ template that are not applicable to the target resource, the workflow will\
        \ not be created, and the `meta` property will be included in the response\
        \ body detailing which parameters need to be updated.\n"

      description: "Update a segment. The request body must be a valid semantic patch,\
        \ JSON patch, or JSON merge patch. To learn more the different formats, read\
        \ [Updates](/#section/Overview/Updates).\n\n### Using semantic patches on\
        \ a segment\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nThe body of a semantic\
        \ patch request for updating segments requires an `environmentKey` in addition\
        \ to `instructions` and an optional `comment`. The body of the request takes\
        \ the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description\
        \ of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly\
        \ environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the\
        \ update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a\
        \ `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters,\
        \ you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object.\n\n\
        ### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions\
        \ for updating segments.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions\
        \ for <strong>updating segments</strong></summary>\n\n#### addIncludedTargets\n\
        \nAdds context keys to the individual context targets included in the segment\
        \ for the specified `contextKind`. Returns an error if this causes the same\
        \ context key to be both included and excluded.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `contextKind`:\
        \ The context kind the targets should be added to.\n- `values`: List of keys.\n\
        \nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\":\
        \ \"addIncludedTargets\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"org\",\n    \"values\":\
        \ [ \"org-key-123abc\", \"org-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addIncludedUsers\n\
        \nAdds user keys to the individual user targets included in the segment. Returns\
        \ an error if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.\
        \ If you are working with contexts, use `addIncludedTargets` instead of this\
        \ instruction.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\nHere's\
        \ an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addIncludedUsers\"\
        ,\n    \"values\": [ \"user-key-123abc\", \"user-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n\
        ```\n\n#### addExcludedTargets\n\nAdds context keys to the individual context\
        \ targets excluded in the segment for the specified `contextKind`. Returns\
        \ an error if this causes the same context key to be both included and excluded.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should\
        \ be added to.\n- `values`: List of keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addExcludedTargets\",\n    \"contextKind\"\
        : \"org\",\n    \"values\": [ \"org-key-123abc\", \"org-key-456def\" ]\n \
        \ }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addExcludedUsers\n\nAdds user keys to the individual\
        \ user targets excluded from the segment. Returns an error if this causes\
        \ the same user key to be both included and excluded. If you are working with\
        \ contexts, use `addExcludedTargets` instead of this instruction.\n\n#####\
        \ Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addExcludedUsers\",\n    \"values\"\
        : [ \"user-key-123abc\", \"user-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeIncludedTargets\n\
        \nRemoves context keys from the individual context targets included in the\
        \ segment for the specified `contextKind`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `contextKind`:\
        \ The context kind the targets should be removed from.\n- `values`: List of\
        \ keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"\
        kind\": \"removeIncludedTargets\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"org\",\n    \"\
        values\": [ \"org-key-123abc\", \"org-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n####\
        \ removeIncludedUsers\n\nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets\
        \ included in the segment. If you are working with contexts, use `removeIncludedTargets`\
        \ instead of this instruction.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of\
        \ user keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n\
        \    \"kind\": \"removeIncludedUsers\",\n    \"values\": [ \"user-key-123abc\"\
        , \"user-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeExcludedTargets\n\nRemoves\
        \ context keys from the individual context targets excluded from the segment\
        \ for the specified `contextKind`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `contextKind`:\
        \ The context kind the targets should be removed from.\n- `values`: List of\
        \ keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"\
        kind\": \"removeExcludedTargets\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"org\",\n    \"\
        values\": [ \"org-key-123abc\", \"org-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n####\
        \ removeExcludedUsers\n\nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets\
        \ excluded from the segment. If you are working with contexts, use `removeExcludedTargets`\
        \ instead of this instruction.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of\
        \ user keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n\
        \    \"kind\": \"removeExcludedUsers\",\n    \"values\": [ \"user-key-123abc\"\
        , \"user-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates the name\
        \ of the segment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Name of the segment.\n\
        \nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\":\
        \ \"updateName\",\n    \"value\": \"Updated segment name\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\
        \n</details>\n\n## Using JSON patches on a segment\n\nIf you do not include\
        \ the header described above, you can use a [JSON patch](/reference#updates-using-json-patch)\
        \ or [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) representation\
        \ of the desired changes.\n\nFor example, to update the description for a\
        \ segment with a JSON patch, use the following request body:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"replace\",\n      \"path\": \"/description\"\
        ,\n      \"value\": \"new description\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo update fields\
        \ in the segment that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field\
        \ and then append `/<array index>`. Use `/0` to add the new entry to the beginning\
        \ of the array. Use `/-` to add the new entry to the end of the array.\n\n\
        For example, to add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:\n\
        \n```json\n{\n  \"patch\":[\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\"\
        : \"/rules/0\",\n      \"value\": {\n        \"clauses\": [{ \"contextKind\"\
        : \"user\", \"attribute\": \"email\", \"op\": \"endsWith\", \"values\": [\"\
        .edu\"], \"negate\": false }]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo add or remove\
        \ targets from segments, we recommend using semantic patch. Semantic patch\
        \ for segments includes specific instructions for adding and removing both\
        \ included and excluded targets.\n"

        \ context as an individual target.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `targetType`:\
        \ The type of individual target for this context. Must be either `included`\
        \ or `excluded`.\n- `contextKey`: The context key.\n- `contextKind`: The kind\

        \ have 0 members\n  - A request with `nomembers:false` returns teams that\
        \ have 1 or more members\n\n### Expanding the teams response\nLaunchDarkly\
        \ supports four fields for expanding the \"List teams\" response. By default,\
        \ these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\nTo expand the response,\
        \ append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with\

        * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have\

    patch:
      description: "Perform a partial update to a team. Updating a team uses the semantic\
        \ patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating\
        \ teams.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating\
        \ teams</strong></summary>\n\n#### addCustomRoles\n\nAdds custom roles to\
        \ the team. Team members will have these custom roles granted to them.\n\n\
        ##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of custom role keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\
        \n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addCustomRoles\",\n\
        \    \"values\": [ \"example-custom-role\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeCustomRoles\n\
        \nRemoves custom roles from the team. The app will no longer grant these custom\
        \ roles to the team members.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of custom\
        \ role keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n\
        \    \"kind\": \"removeCustomRoles\",\n    \"values\": [ \"example-custom-role\"\
        \ ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addMembers\n\nAdds members to the team.\n\n#####\
        \ Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of member IDs to add.\n\nHere's an example:\n\
        \n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addMembers\",\n    \"\
        values\": [ \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\", \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ]\n\
        \  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeMembers\n\nRemoves members from the team.\n\n\
        ##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of member IDs to remove.\n\nHere's an\
        \ example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"removeMembers\"\
        ,\n    \"values\": [ \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\", \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\"\
        \ ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### replaceMembers\n\nReplaces the existing members\
        \ of the team with the new members.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List\
        \ of member IDs of the new members.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\
        \  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"replaceMembers\",\n    \"values\"\
        : [ \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\", \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ]\n  }]\n}\n\
        ```\n\n#### addPermissionGrants\n\nAdds permission grants to members for the\
        \ team. For example, a permission grant could allow a member to act as a team\
        \ maintainer. A permission grant may have either an `actionSet` or a list\
        \ of `actions` but not both at the same time. The members do not have to be\
        \ team members to have a permission grant for the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n- `actionSet`: Name of the action set.\n- `actions`: List of actions.\n\

        \ the teams response\nLaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the\
        \ \"Update team\" response. By default, these fields are **not** included\
        \ in the response.\n\nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter\
        \ and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:\n\n* `members`\
        \ includes the total count of members that belong to the team.\n* `roles`\
        \ includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to\
        \ the team.\n* `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the\
        \ team has any write access to.\n* `maintainers` includes a paginated list\
        \ of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.\n\nFor example, `expand=members,roles`\
        \ includes the `members` and `roles` fields in the response.\n"

        \n**Members are only added on a `201` response.** A `207` indicates the CSV\
