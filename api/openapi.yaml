    # Overview

    ## Authentication

    All REST API resources are authenticated with either [personal or service access tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens), or session cookies. Other authentication mechanisms are not supported. You can manage personal access tokens on your [Account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.

    LaunchDarkly also has SDK keys, mobile keys, and client-side IDs that are used by our server-side SDKs, mobile SDKs, and client-side SDKs, respectively. **These keys cannot be used to access our REST API**. These keys are environment-specific, and can only perform read-only operations (fetching feature flag settings).

    > #### Keep your access tokens and SDK keys private
    >
    > Access tokens should _never_ be exposed in untrusted contexts. Never put an access token in client-side JavaScript, or embed it in a mobile application. LaunchDarkly has special mobile keys that you can embed in mobile apps. If you accidentally expose an access token or SDK key, you can reset it from your [Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/tokens) page.
    >
    > The client-side ID is safe to embed in untrusted contexts. It's designed for use in client-side JavaScript.

    ### Via request header

    The preferred way to authenticate with the API is by adding an `Authorization` header containing your access token to your requests. The value of the `Authorization` header must be your access token.

    Manage personal access tokens from the [Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.

    ### Via session cookie

    For testing purposes, you can make API calls directly from your web browser. If you're logged in to the application, the API will use your existing session to authenticate calls.

    If you have a [role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/built-in-roles) other than Admin, or have a [custom role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/custom-roles) defined, you may not have permission to perform some API calls. You will receive a `401` response code in that case.

    > ### Modifying the Origin header causes an error
    >
    > LaunchDarkly validates that the Origin header for any API request authenticated by a session cookie matches the expected Origin header. The expected Origin header is `https://app.launchdarkly.com`.
    >
    > If the Origin header does not match what's expected, LaunchDarkly returns an error. This error can prevent the LaunchDarkly app from working correctly.
    >
    > Any browser extension that intentionally changes the Origin header can cause this problem. For example, the `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` Chrome extension changes the Origin header to `http://evil.com` and causes the app to fail.
    >
    > To prevent this error, do not modify your Origin header.
    >
    > LaunchDarkly does not require origin matching when authenticating with an access token, so this issue does not affect normal API usage.

    ## Representations

    All resources expect and return JSON response bodies. Error responses will also send a JSON body. Read [Errors](#section/Errors) for a more detailed description of the error format used by the API.

    In practice this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

    In addition, request bodies for `PUT`, `POST`, `REPORT` and `PATCH` requests must be encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

    ### Summary and detailed representations

    When you fetch a list of resources, the response includes only the most important attributes of each resource. This is a _summary representation_ of the resource. When you fetch an individual resource, such as a single feature flag, you receive a _detailed representation_ of the resource.

    The best way to find a detailed representation is to follow links. Every summary representation includes a link to its detailed representation.

    In most cases, the detailed representation contains all of the attributes of the resource. In a few cases, the detailed representation contains many, but not all, of the attributes of the resource. Typically this happens when an attribute of the requested resource is itself paginated. You can request that the response include a particular attribute by using the `expand` request parameter.

    ### Links and addressability

    The best way to navigate the API is by following links. These are attributes in representations that link to other resources. The API always uses the same format for links:

    - Links to other resources within the API are encapsulated in a `_links` object.
    - If the resource has a corresponding link to HTML content on the site, it is stored in a special `_site` link.

    Each link has two attributes: an href (the URL) and a type (the content type). For example, a feature resource might return the following:

    ```json
    {
      "_links": {
        "parent": {
          "href": "/api/features",
          "type": "application/json"
        },
        "self": {
          "href": "/api/features/sort.order",
          "type": "application/json"
        }
      },
      "_site": {
        "href": "/features/sort.order",
        "type": "text/html"
      }
    }
    ```

    From this, you can navigate to the parent collection of features by following the `parent` link, or navigate to the site page for the feature by following the `_site` link.

    Collections are always represented as a JSON object with an `items` attribute containing an array of representations. Like all other representations, collections have `_links` defined at the top level.

    Paginated collections include `first`, `last`, `next`, and `prev` links containing a URL with the respective set of elements in the collection.

    ### Expanding responses

    Sometimes the detailed representation of a resource does not include all of the attributes of the resource by default. If this is the case, the request method will clearly document this and describe which attributes you can include in an expanded response.

    To include the additional attributes, append the `expand` request parameter to your request and add a comma-separated list of the attributes to include. For example, when you append `?expand=members,roles` to the [Get team](/tag/Teams-(beta)#operation/getTeam) endpoint, the expanded response includes both of these attributes.

    ## Updates

    Resources that accept partial updates use the `PATCH` verb, and support the [JSON Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) format. Some resources also support the [JSON Merge Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) format. In addition, some resources support optional comments that can be submitted with updates. Comments appear in outgoing webhooks, the audit log, and other integrations.

    ### Updates via JSON Patch

    [JSON Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource. For example, in this feature flag representation:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "New recommendations engine",
        "key": "engine.enable",
        "description": "This is the description",
        ...
    }
    ```

    You can change the feature flag's description with the following patch document:

    ```json
    [{ "op": "replace", "path": "/description", "value": "This is the new description" }]
    ```

    JSON Patch documents are always arrays. You can specify multiple modifications to perform in a single request. You can also test that certain preconditions are met before applying the patch:

    ```json
    [
      { "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 10 },
      { "op": "replace", "path": "/description", "value": "The new description" }
    ]
    ```

    The above patch request tests whether the feature flag's `version` is `10`, and if so, changes the feature flag's description.

    Attributes that aren't editable, like a resource's `_links`, have names that start with an underscore.

    ### Updates via JSON Merge Patch

    The API also supports the [JSON Merge Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) format, as well as the [Update feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/patchFeatureFlag) resource.

    JSON Merge Patch is less expressive than JSON Patch but in many cases, it is simpler to construct a merge patch document. For example, you can change a feature flag's description with the following merge patch document:

    ```json
    {
      "description": "New flag description"
    }
    ```

    ### Updates with comments

    You can submit optional comments with `PATCH` changes. The [Update feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/patchFeatureFlag) resource supports comments.

    To submit a comment along with a JSON Patch document, use the following format:

    ```json
    {
      "comment": "This is a comment string",
      "patch": [{ "op": "replace", "path": "/description", "value": "The new description" }]
    }
    ```

    To submit a comment along with a JSON Merge Patch document, use the following format:

    ```json
    {
      "comment": "This is a comment string",
      "merge": { "description": "New flag description" }
    }
    ```

    ### Updates via semantic patches

    The API also supports the Semantic patch format. A semantic `PATCH` is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource as a set of executable instructions.

    JSON Patch uses paths and a limited set of operations to describe how to transform the current state of the resource into a new state. Semantic patch allows you to be explicit about intent using precise, custom instructions. In many cases, semantic patch instructions can also be defined independently of the current state of the resource. This can be useful when defining a change that may be applied at a future date.

    For example, in this feature flag configuration in environment Production:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Alternate sort order",
        "kind": "boolean",
        "key": "sort.order",
       ...
        "environments": {
            "production": {
                "on": true,
                "archived": false,
                "salt": "c29ydC5vcmRlcg==",
                "sel": "8de1085cb7354b0ab41c0e778376dfd3",
                "lastModified": 1469131558260,
                "version": 81,
                "targets": [
                    {
                        "values": [
                            "Gerhard.Little@yahoo.com"
                        ],
                        "variation": 0
                    },
                    {
                        "values": [
                            "1461797806429-33-861961230",
                            "438580d8-02ee-418d-9eec-0085cab2bdf0"
                        ],
                        "variation": 1
                    }
                ],
                "rules": [],
                "fallthrough": {
                    "variation": 0
                },
                "offVariation": 1,
                "prerequisites": [],
                "_site": {
                    "href": "/default/production/features/sort.order",
                    "type": "text/html"
                }
           }
        }
    }
    ```

    You can add a date you want a user to be removed from the feature flag's user targets. For example, “remove user 1461797806429-33-861961230 from the user target for variation 0 on the Alternate sort order flag in the production environment on Wed Jul 08 2020 at 15:27:41 pm”. This is done using the following:

    ```json
    {
      "comment": "update expiring user targets",
      "instructions": [
        {
          "kind": "removeExpireUserTargetDate",
          "userKey": "userKey",
          "variationId": "978d53f9-7fe3-4a63-992d-97bcb4535dc8"
        },
        {
          "kind": "updateExpireUserTargetDate",
          "userKey": "userKey2",
          "variationId": "978d53f9-7fe3-4a63-992d-97bcb4535dc8",
          "value": 1587582000000
        },
        {
          "kind": "addExpireUserTargetDate",
          "userKey": "userKey3",
          "variationId": "978d53f9-7fe3-4a63-992d-97bcb4535dc8",
          "value": 1594247266386
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Here is another example. In this feature flag configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "New recommendations engine",
      "key": "engine.enable",
      "environments": {
        "test": {
          "on": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    You can change the feature flag's description with the following patch document as a set of executable instructions. For example, “add user X to targets for variation Y and remove user A from targets for variation B for test flag”:

    ```json
    {
      "comment": "",
      "instructions": [
        {
          "kind": "removeUserTargets",
          "values": ["438580d8-02ee-418d-9eec-0085cab2bdf0"],
          "variationId": "852cb784-54ff-46b9-8c35-5498d2e4f270"
        },
        {
          "kind": "addUserTargets",
          "values": ["438580d8-02ee-418d-9eec-0085cab2bdf0"],
          "variationId": "1bb18465-33b6-49aa-a3bd-eeb6650b33ad"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    ## Errors

    The API always returns errors in a common format. Here's an example:

    ```json
    {
      "code": "invalid_request",
      "message": "A feature with that key already exists",
      "id": "30ce6058-87da-11e4-b116-123b93f75cba"
    }
    ```

    The general class of error is indicated by the `code`. The `message` is a human-readable explanation of what went wrong. The `id` is a unique identifier. Use it when you're working with LaunchDarkly support to debug a problem with a specific API call.

    ### HTTP Status - Error Response Codes

    | Code | Definition        | Desc.                                                                                       | Possible Solution                                                |
    | ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 400  | Bad Request       | A request that fails may return this HTTP response code.                                    | Ensure JSON syntax in request body is correct.                   |
    | 401  | Unauthorized      | User doesn't have permission to an API call.                                                | Ensure your SDK key is good.                                     |
    | 403  | Forbidden         | User does not have permission for operation.                                                | Ensure that the user or access token has proper permissions set. |
    | 409  | Conflict          | The API request could not be completed because it conflicted with a concurrent API request. | Retry your request.                                              |
    | 429  | Too many requests | See [Rate limiting](/#section/Rate-limiting).                                               | Wait and try again later.                                        |

    ## CORS

    The LaunchDarkly API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. If an `Origin` header is given in a request, it will be echoed as an explicitly allowed origin. Otherwise, a wildcard is returned: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. For more information on CORS, see the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors). Example CORS headers might look like:

    ```http
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, Authorization
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Max-Age: 300
    ```

    You can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin calls, using either [token or session-based authentication](#section/Authentication). If you’re using session auth, you should set the `withCredentials` property for your `xhr` request to `true`. You should never expose your access tokens to untrusted users.

    ## Rate limiting

    We use several rate limiting strategies to ensure the availability of our APIs. Rate-limited calls to our APIs will return a `429` status code. Calls to our APIs will include headers indicating the current rate limit status. The specific headers returned depend on the API route being called. The limits differ based on the route, authentication mechanism, and other factors. Routes that are not rate limited may not contain any of the headers described below.

    > ### Rate limiting and SDKs
    >
    > LaunchDarkly SDKs are never rate limited and do not use the API endpoints defined here. LaunchDarkly uses a different set of approaches, including streaming/server-sent events and a global CDN, to ensure availability to the routes used by LaunchDarkly SDKs.
    >
    > The client-side ID is safe to embed in untrusted contexts. It's designed for use in client-side JavaScript.

    ### Global rate limits

    Authenticated requests are subject to a global limit. This is the maximum number of calls that can be made to the API per ten seconds. All personal access tokens on the account share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token will impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to global rate limits will return the headers below:

    | Header name                    | Description                                                                      |
    | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `X-Ratelimit-Global-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |
    | `X-Ratelimit-Reset`            | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.    |

    We do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be made globally. This limit may change, and we encourage clients to program against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding to the current limit.

    ### Route-level rate limits

    Some authenticated routes have custom rate limits. These also reset every ten seconds. Any access tokens hitting the same route share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token may impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to route-level rate limits will return the headers below:

    | Header name                   | Description                                                                                           |
    | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `X-Ratelimit-Route-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests to the current route the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |
    | `X-Ratelimit-Reset`           | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.                         |

    A _route_ represents a specific URL pattern and verb. For example, the [Delete environment](/tag/Environments#operation/deleteEnvironment) endpoint is considered a single route, and each call to delete an environment counts against your route-level rate limit for that route.

    We do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be made to each endpoint per ten seconds. These limits may change, and we encourage clients to program against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding to the current limits.

    ### IP-based rate limiting

    We also employ IP-based rate limiting on some API routes. If you hit an IP-based rate limit, your API response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before re-trying the call. Clients must wait at least `Retry-After` seconds before making additional calls to our API, and should employ jitter and backoff strategies to avoid triggering rate limits again.

    ## OpenAPI (Swagger)

    We have a [complete OpenAPI (Swagger) specification](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/openapi.json) for our API.

    You can use this specification to generate client libraries to interact with our REST API in your language of choice.

    This specification is supported by several API-based tools such as Postman and Insomnia. In many cases, you can directly import our specification to ease use in navigating the APIs in the tooling.

    ## Client libraries

    We auto-generate multiple client libraries based on our OpenAPI specification. To learn more, visit [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-api+org%3Alaunchdarkly&type=Repositories).

    ## Method Overriding

    Some firewalls and HTTP clients restrict the use of verbs other than `GET` and `POST`. In those environments, our API endpoints that use `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` verbs will be inaccessible.

    To avoid this issue, our API supports the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, allowing clients to "tunnel" `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests via a `POST` request.

    For example, if you wish to call one of our `PATCH` resources via a `POST` request, you can include `X-HTTP-Method-Override:PATCH` as a header.

    ## Beta resources

    We sometimes release new API resources in **beta** status before we release them with general availability.

    Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.

    We try to promote resources into general availability as quickly as possible. This happens after sufficient testing and when we're satisfied that we no longer need to make backwards-incompatible changes.

    We mark beta resources with a "Beta" callout in our documentation, pictured below:

    > ### This feature is in beta
    >
    > To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](/#section/Overview/Beta-resources).

    ### Using beta resources

    To use a beta resource, you must include a header in the request. If you call a beta resource without this header, you'll receive a `403` response.

    Use this header:

    ```
    LD-API-Version: beta
    ```

    ## Versioning

    We try hard to keep our REST API backwards compatible, but we occasionally have to make backwards-incompatible changes in the process of shipping new features. These breaking changes can cause unexpected behavior if you don't prepare for them accordingly.

    Updates to our REST API include support for the latest features in LaunchDarkly. We also release a new version of our REST API every time we make a breaking change. We provide simultaneous support for multiple API versions so you can migrate from your current API version to a new version at your own pace.

    ### Setting the API version per request

    You can set the API version on a specific request by sending an `LD-API-Version` header, as shown in the example below:

    ```
    LD-API-Version: 20210729
    ```

    The header value is the version number of the API version you'd like to request. The number for each version corresponds to the date the version was released in yyyymmdd format. In the example above the version `20210729` corresponds to July 29, 2021.

    ### Setting the API version per access token

    When creating an access token, you must specify a specific version of the API to use. This ensures that integrations using this token cannot be broken by version changes.

    Tokens created before versioning was released have their version set to `20160426` (the version of the API that existed before versioning) so that they continue working the same way they did before versioning.

    If you would like to upgrade your integration to use a new API version, you can explicitly set the header described above.

    > ### Best practice: Set the header for every client or integration
    >
    > We recommend that you set the API version header explicitly in any client or integration you build.
    >
    > Only rely on the access token API version during manual testing.

    ### API version changelog

    | Version | Changes |
    |---|---|

    An experiment is a running tally of user behaviors based on which variation of a feature flag they receive. In LaunchDarkly, an experiment requires two things: a metric that defines what user behaviors to track, and at least one flag associated with that metric. To learn more, read [Experimentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/experimentation).

    Experiments are largely managed by making PATCH requests to the flags API. There are also dedicated API resources for getting and deleting experiment data.

    ## Adding an experiment

    To add an experiment to a flag, add a new object to the `/experiments/items/` property.

    The object must contain:

    1. The key of the metric you want to use for the experiment.
    2. (Optional) A list of keys for the environments where the experiment should record data.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
        {
            "op": "add",
            "path": "/experiments/items/0",
            "value": {
                "metricKey": "example-metric",
                "environments": []
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

    ## Removing an experiment

    To remove an experiment, remove the corresponding item from the experiments or items property.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
        {
            "op": "remove",
            "path": "/experiments/items/0"
        }
    ]
    ```

    ## Starting or resuming an experiment

    To start recording data for an experiment in an environment, add the environment key to the list of environments for that experiment.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
        {
            "op": "add",
            "path": "/experiments/items/0/environments/0",
            "value": "production"
        }
    ]
    ```

    ## Pausing an experiment

    To pause collecting data for an experiment in a specific environment, remove the environment from the list that experiment uses.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
      {
        "op": "remove",
        "path": "/experiments/items/0/environments/0"
      }
    ]
    ```

    ## Updating the baseline

    To update the baseline for all experiments on a flag across all environments in the project, replace the `baselineIdx` property with the index of the new baseline variation.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
      {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/experiments/baselineIdx",
        "value": 1
      }
    ]
    ```

    ## Anatomy of a feature flag

    The feature flag API allows you to control percentage rollouts, target specific users, or even toggle off a feature programmatically. By looking at the representation of a feature flag, we can see how to do any of these tasks.

    ## Sample feature flag representation

    Every feature flag has a set of top-level attributes, as well as an `environments` map containing the flag rollout and targeting rules specific to each environment. Top-level attributes include things like the flag's name, description, tags, and creation date. To learn more, read [Using feature flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags).

    For reference, here's a complete feature flag representation. Below we break this down and explain each attribute in detail.

        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Top-level attributes

    Most of the top-level attributes have a straightforward interpretation. For example, to change the name of a feature, [update the feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag) with the `name` attribute set to the new name:

    ```json
    [
        { "op": "replace", "path": "/name", "value": "New name" }
    ]
    ```

    The `variations` array represents the different variation values that a feature flag has. For a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and `false`. Multivariate flags have more variation values, and those values could be any JSON type: numbers, strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting rules, the variations are referred to by their index into this array. Below are some specific examples.

    ## Per-environment configurations

    Each entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object that represents the environment-specific flag configuration data available in the flag's Targeting tab. For example, to toggle off a feature flag in your production environment, use the following JSON patch operation:

    ```json
    [
        { "op": "replace", "path": "/environments/production/on", "value": false }
    ]
    ```

    To learn more, read [Targeting users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).

    Each section of the Targeting tab corresponds to a different attribute of the per-environment configuration data, as shown here:

    ## Individual user targets

    The `targets` array in the per-environment configuration data represents the individual user targeting rules on the Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Targeting users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).

    Each object in the `targets` array represents a list of user keys assigned to a particular variation. For example:

    ```json
    {
        ...
        "environments" : {
            "production" : {
                ...
                "targets": [
                    {
                        "values": ["foo@example.com"],
                        "variation: 0
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    This `targets` array here means that user `foo@example.com` receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. Recall that the variations are stored at the top level of the flag JSON in an array, and the per-environment configuration rules point to indexes into this array. If this is a boolean flag, `foo@example.com` is receiving the `true` variation.

    ## Targeting rules

    The `rules` array corresponds to the custom targeting rules section of the Targeting tab. This is where you can express complex rules on attributes with conditions and operators. For example, a rule like "roll out the `true` variation to 80% of users whose email address ends with `gmail.com` could be expressed here. To learn more, read [Creating targeting rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users#creating-targeting-rules).

    ## The fallthrough rule

    The `fallthrough` object is a special rule that contains no conditions. It is the rollout strategy that is applied when none of the individual or custom targeting rules match.

    ## The off variation

    The off variation represents the variation to serve if the feature flag is turned off, meaning the `on` attribute is `false`. For boolean flags, this is usually `false`. For multivariate flags, set the off variation to whatever variation represents the control or baseline behavior for your application. If you don't set the off variation, LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.

    ## Percentage rollouts

    The `weight` attribute defines the percentage rollout for each variation. Weights range from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout). The weights are scaled by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can be represented without using floating-point. For example, a weight of `50000` means that 50% of users that don't otherwise match any `targets` will see that variation. The sum of weights across all variations should be 100%.

    Flag links let you view external mentions of flags from other tools and services. Links to external conversations and references to your flags allow you to collaborate more easily and quickly review relevant flag contexts. To learn more, read [Flag links](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/links).

    You can create custom flag links by associating an external URL with a feature flag. After you create a flag link, it applies across all your environments. You should exercise caution when deleting a flag link, as it will be deleted from all your environments.

    Using the flag links API, you can view, create, update, and delete links to flags.

    Audit log integration subscriptions allow you to send audit log events hooks to one of dozens of external tools. For example, you can send flag change event webhooks to external third party software. To learn more, read [Building your own integrations](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/integrations/building-integrations#building-your-own-integrations).

    You can use the integrations subscriptions API to create, delete, and manage your integration audit log subscriptions.

    Each of these operations requires an `integrationKey` that refers to the type of integration. The required `config` fields to create a subscription vary depending on the `integrationKey`. You can find a full list of the fields for each integration below.

    ### Configuration bodies by integrationKey

    The webhooks API lets you build your own integrations that subscribe to activities in LaunchDarkly. When you generate an activity in LaunchDarkly, such as when you change a flag or you create a project, LaunchDarkly sends an HTTP POST payload to the webhook's URL. Use webhooks to update external issue trackers, update support tickets, notify customers of new feature rollouts, and more.

    ## Designating the payload

    The webhook payload is identical to an [Audit log entry](/tag/Audit-log#operation/getAuditLogEntry).

    Here's a sample payload:

    > ### Webhook delivery order
    >
    > Webhooks may not be delivered in chronological order. We recommend using the payload's "date" field as a timestamp to reorder webhooks as they are received.

    ```json

        "lastName": "Applebaum"
      },
      "titleVerb": "changed the name of",
      "title": "[Reese Applebaum](mailto:refapp@launchdarkly.com) changed the name of [Testing](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)",

          }
        },
        "name": "Testing",
        "resources": ["proj/alexis:env/test"]
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Signing the webhook

    Optionally, you can define a `secret` when you create a webhook. If you define the secret, the webhook `POST` request will include an `X-LD-Signature header`, whose value will contain an HMAC SHA256 hex digest of the webhook payload, using the `secret` as the key.

    Compute the signature of the payload using the same shared secret in your code to verify that the webhook was triggered by LaunchDarkly.

    ## Understanding connection retries

    If LaunchDarkly receives a non-`2xx` response to a webhook `POST`, it will retry the delivery one time. Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If you build an integration on webhooks, make sure it is tolerant of delivery failures.

    > Workflows is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

    A workflow is a set of actions that you can schedule in advance to make changes to a feature flag. You can also include approval requests at different stages of a workflow. To learn more, read [Workflows](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows).

    The actions supported are as follows:

    - Turning targeting `ON` or `OFF`
    - Setting the default variation
    - Creating a rule to target a group of users by segment
    - Modifying the rollout percentage for rules

    You can create multiple stages of a flag release workflow. Unique stages are defined by their conditions: either approvals and/or scheduled changes.

      summary: Get feature flag status

  /api/v2/flags/{projectKey}:
    get:
      description: |
        Get a list of all features in the given project. By default, each feature includes configurations for each environment. You can filter environments with the env query parameter. For example, setting `env=production` restricts the returned configurations to just your production environment. You can also filter feature flags by tag with the tag query parameter.

        We support the following fields for filters:

        - `query` is a string that matches against the flags' keys and names. It is not case sensitive.
        - `archived` is a boolean to filter the list to archived flags. When this is absent, only unarchived flags are returned.
        - `type` is a string allowing filtering to `temporary` or `permanent` flags.
        - `status` is a string allowing filtering to `new`, `inactive`, `active`, or `launched` flags in the specified environment. This filter also requires a `filterEnv` field to be set to a valid environment. For example: `filter=status:active,filterEnv:production`.
        - `tags` is a + separated list of tags. It filters the list to members who have all of the tags in the list.
        - `hasExperiment` is a boolean with values of true or false and returns any flags that have an attached metric.
        - `hasDataExport` is a boolean with values of true or false and returns any flags that are currently exporting data in the specified environment. This includes flags that are exporting data via Experimentation. This filter also requires a `filterEnv` field to be set to a valid environment key. e.g. `filter=hasExperiment:true,filterEnv:production`
        - `evaluated` is an object that contains a key of `after` and a value in Unix time in milliseconds. This returns all flags that have been evaluated since the time you specify in the environment provided. This filter also requires a `filterEnv` field to be set to a valid environment. For example: `filter=evaluated:{"after": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production`.
        - `filterEnv` is a string with the key of a valid environment. The filterEnv field is used for filters that are environment specific. If there are multiple environment specific filters you should only declare this parameter once. For example: `filter=evaluated:{"after": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production,status:active`.

        An example filter is `query:abc,tags:foo+bar`. This matches flags with the string `abc` in their key or name, ignoring case, which also have the tags `foo` and `bar`.

        By default, this returns all flags. You can page through the list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links will not be present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.

        ## Using semantic patches on a feature flag

        To use a [semantic patch](/reference#updates-via-semantic-patches) on a feature flag resource, you must include a header in the request. If you call a semantic patch resource without this header, you will receive a `400` response because your semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON patch.

        Use this header:

        ```
        Content-Type: application/json; domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch
        ```

        The body of a semantic patch request takes the following three properties:

        1. `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.
        1. `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.
        1. `instructions` (array): (Required) The list of actions to be performed by the update. Each action in the list must be an object/hash table with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. Depending on the `kind`, the API may require other parameters. When this is the case, add the parameters as additional fields to the instruction object. Read below for more information on the specific supported semantic patch instructions.

        If any instruction in the patch encounters an error, the error will be returned and the flag will not be changed. In general, instructions will silently do nothing if the flag is already in the state requested by the patch instruction. For example, `removeUserTargets` does nothing when the targets have already been removed. They will generally error if a parameter refers to something that does not exist, like a variation ID that doesn't correspond to a variation on the flag or a rule ID that doesn't belong to a rule on the flag. Other specific error conditions are noted in the instruction descriptions.

        ### Instructions

        #### `turnFlagOn`

        Sets the flag's targeting state to on.

        For example, to flip a flag on, use this request body:

        ```json
        {
          "environmentKey": "example-environment-key",
          "instructions": [ { "kind": "turnFlagOn" } ]
        }
        ```

        #### `turnFlagOff`

        Sets the flag's targeting state to off.

        For example, to flip a flag off, use this request body:

        ```json
        {
          "environmentKey": "example-environment-key",
          "instructions": [ { "kind": "turnFlagOff" } ]
        }
        ```

        #### `addUserTargets`

        Adds the user keys in `values` to the individual user targets for the variation specified by `variationId`. Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be targeted in multiple variations.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of user keys
        - `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag

        #### `removeUserTargets`

        Removes the user keys in `values` to the individual user targets for the variation specified by `variationId`. Does nothing if the user keys are not targeted.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of user keys
        - `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag

        #### `replaceUserTargets`

        Completely replaces the existing set of user targeting. All variations must be provided. Example:

        ```json
        {
          "kind": "replaceUserTargets",
          "targets": [
            {
              "variationId": "variation-1",

            },
            {
              "variationId": "variation-2",
              "values": ["abc", "def"]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        ## Using JSON Patches on a feature flag
        If you do not include the header described above, you can use [JSON patch](/reference#updates-via-json-patch).

        When using the update feature flag endpoint to add individual users to a specific variation, there are two different patch documents, depending on whether users are already being individually targeted for the variation.

        If a flag variation already has users individually targeted, the path for the JSON Patch operation is:

        ```json
        {
          "op": "add",
          "path": "/environments/devint/targets/0/values/-",
          "value": "TestClient10"
        }
        ```

        If a flag variation does not already have users individually targeted, the path for the JSON Patch operation is:

        ```json
        [
          {
            "op": "add",
            "path": "/environments/devint/targets/-",
            "value": { "variation": 0, "values": ["TestClient10"] }
          }
        ]
        ```


        ## Required approvals
        If a request attempts to alter a flag configuration in an environment where approvals are required for the flag, the request will fail with a 405. Changes to the flag configuration in that environment will required creating an [approval request](/tag/Approvals) or a [workflow](/tag/Workflows-(beta)).

        ## Conflicts
        If a flag configuration change made through this endpoint would cause a pending scheduled change or approval request to fail, this endpoint will return a 400. You can ignore this check by adding an `ignoreConflicts` query parameter set to `true`.

  /api/v2/members:
    get:
      description: |
        Return a list of account members.

        By default, this returns the first 20 members. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.

        ### Filtering members

        LaunchDarkly supports three fields for filters: `query`, `role`, and `lastSeen`:

        - `query` is a string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.
        - `role` is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. It filters the list to members who have any of the roles in the list. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.
        - `lastSeen` is a JSON object in one of the following formats:
          - `{"never": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.
          - `{"noData": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.
          - `{"before": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.

        For example, the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole` matches members with the string `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case, who also are either an an `Owner` or `Admin` or have the custom role `customrole`.

        ### Sorting members

        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName` and `lastSeen`:

        - `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the member's email if no name is set.
        - `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen` property. LaunchDarkly considers members that have never been seen or have no data the oldest.

        > The ability to bulk invite members is a paid feature. Single members may be invited if not on a paid plan.

        Invite one or more new members to join an account. Each member is sent an invitation. Members with "admin" or "owner" roles may create new members, as well as anyone with a "createMember" permission for "member/\*". If a member cannot be invited, the entire request is rejected and no members are invited from that request.

        Each member _must_ have an `email` field and either a `role` or a `customRoles` field. If any of the fields are not populated correctly, the request is rejected with the reason specified in the "message" field of the response.

        Requests to create account members will not work if SCIM is enabled for the account.

        _No more than 50 members may be created per request._

        A request may also fail because of conflicts with existing members. These conflicts are reported using the additional `code` and `invalid_emails` response fields with the following possible values for `code`:

        - **email_already_exists_in_account**: A member with this email address already exists in this account.
        - **email_taken_in_different_account**: A member with this email address exists in another account.
        - **duplicate_email**s: This request contains two or more members with the same email address.

        A request that fails for one of the above reasons returns an HTTP response code of 400 (Bad Request).

      description: |2

        Update a single account member. The request should be a valid JSON Patch document describing the changes to be made to the member.

        To update fields in the account member object that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Using `/0` appends to the beginning of the array. For example, to add a new custom role to a member, use the following request body:

        ```
          [
            {
              "op": "add",
              "path": "/customRoles/0",
              "value": "some-role-id"
            }
          ]
        ```

        Requests to update account members will not work if SCIM is enabled for the account.

      description: |2

        Update an environment. Requires a [JSON Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) representation of the desired changes to the environment.

        To update fields in the environment object that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Using `/0` appends to the beginning of the array.

        ### Approval settings

        This request only returns the `approvalSettings` key if the [Flag Approvals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/approvals) feature is enabled.

        Only the `canReviewOwnRequest`, `canApplyDeclinedChanges`, `minNumApprovals`, `required` and `requiredApprovalTagsfields` are editable.

        If you try to patch the environment by setting both `required` and `requiredApprovalTags`, the request fails and an error appears. You can specify either required approvals for all flags in an environment or those with specific tags, but not both.

      summary: Get segment
      tags:

    patch:
      description: |
        Update a user segment. The request body must be a valid JSON patch, JSON merge patch, or semantic patch.

        ## Using semantic patches on a segment

        To use a [semantic patch](/reference#updates-via-semantic-patches) on a segment resource, you must include a header in the request. If you call a semantic patch resource without this header, you will receive a `400` response because your semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON patch.

        Use this header:

        ```
        Content-Type: application/json; domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch
        ```

        The body of a semantic patch request takes the following three properties:

        1. `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.
        1. `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.
        1. `instructions` (array): (Required) The list of actions to be performed by the update. Each action in the list must be an object/hash table with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. Depending on the `kind`, the API may require other parameters. When this is the case, add the parameters as additional fields to the instruction object. Read below for more information on the specific supported semantic patch instructions.

        If any instruction in the patch encounters an error, the error will be returned and the segment will not be changed. In general, instructions will silently do nothing if the segment is already in the state requested by the patch instruction. For example, `addIncludedUsers` does nothing when the targets have already been included.
        Specific error conditions are noted in the instruction descriptions.

        ### Instructions

        #### `addIncludedUsers`

        Adds the user keys in `values` to the individual user targets included in the segment. Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of user keys

        #### `addExcludedUsers`

        Adds the user keys in `values` to the individual user targets excluded from the segment. Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of user keys

        #### `removeIncludedUsers`

        Removes the user keys in `values` from the individual user targets included in the segment.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of user keys

        #### `removeExcludedUsers`

        Removes the user keys in `values` from the individual user targets excluded from the segment.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of user keys

        #### `updateName`

        Updates the name of the segment to the string provided in `value`.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: string

        ## Using JSON patches on a segment

        If you do not include the header described above, you can use [JSON patch](/reference#updates-via-json-patch).

        For example, to update the description for a segment, use the following request body:

        ```json
        {
          "patch": [
            {
              "op": "replace",
              "path": "/description",
              "value": "new description"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        To update fields in the segment that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Using `/0` adds the new entry to the beginning of the array.

        For example, to add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:

        ```json
        {
          "patch":[
            {
              "op": "add",
              "path": "/rules/0",
              "value": {
                "clauses": [{ "attribute": "email", "op": "endsWith", "values": [".edu"], "negate": false }]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        To add or remove users from segments, we recommend using semantic patch. Semantic patch for segments includes specific `instructions` for adding and removing both included and excluded users.

        Return a list of teams.

        By default, this returns the first 20 teams. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.

        ### Filtering teams

        LaunchDarkly supports the `query` field for filtering. `query` is a string that matches against the teams' names and keys. It is not case sensitive. For example, the filter `query:abc` matches teams with the string `abc` in their name or key.

    patch:
      description: |
        Perform a partial update to a team.

        The body of a semantic patch request takes the following three properties:

        1. comment `string`: (Optional) A description of the update.
        1. instructions `array`: (Required) The action or list of actions to be performed by the update. Each update action in the list must be an object/hash table with a `kind` property, although depending on the action, other properties may be necessary. Read below for more information on the specific supported semantic patch instructions.

        If any instruction in the patch encounters an error, the error will be returned and the flag will not be changed. In general, instructions will silently do nothing if the flag is already in the state requested by the patch instruction. They will generally error if a parameter refers to something that does not exist. Other specific error conditions are noted in the instruction descriptions.

        ### Instructions

        #### `addCustomRoles`

        Adds custom roles to the team. Team members will have these custom roles granted to them.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of custom role keys

        #### `removeCustomRoles`

        Removes the custom roles on the team. Team members will no longer have these custom roles granted to them.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of custom role keys

        #### `addMembers`

        Adds members to the team.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of member IDs

        #### `removeMembers`

        Removes members from the team.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: list of member IDs

        #### `addPermissionGrants`

        Adds permission grants to members for the team, allowing them to, for example, act as a team maintainer. A permission grant may have either an `actionSet` or a list of `actions` but not both at the same time. The members do not have to be team members to have a permission grant for the team.

        ##### Parameters

        - `actionSet`: name of the action set
        - `actions`: list of actions
        - `memberIDs`: list of member IDs

        #### `removePermissionGrants`

        Removes permission grants from members for the team. The `actionSet` and `actions` must match an existing permission grant.

        ##### Parameters

        - `actionSet`: name of the action set
        - `actions`: list of actions
        - `memberIDs`: list of member IDs

        #### `updateDescription`

        Updates the team's description.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: the team's new description

        #### `updateName`

        Updates the team's name.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: the team's new name

  /api/v2/teams/{teamKey}/members:
    post:
      description: |
        Add multiple members to an existing team by uploading a CSV file of member email addresses. Your CSV file must include email addresses in the first column. You can include data in additional columns, but LaunchDarkly ignores all data outside the first column. Headers are optional. To learn more, read [Managing team members](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/teams/managing#managing-team-members).

        **Members are only added on a `201` response.** A `207` indicates the CSV file contains a combination of valid and invalid entries and will _not_ result in any members being added to the team.

        On a `207` response, if an entry contains bad user input the `message` field will contain the row number as well as the reason for the error. The `message` field will be omitted if the entry is valid.

        Example `207` response:
        ```json
        {
          "items": [
            {
              "status": "success",
              "value": "a-valid-email@launchdarkly.com"
            },
            {
              "message": "Line 2: empty row",
              "status": "error",
              "value": ""
            },
            {
              "message": "Line 3: email already exists in the specified team",
              "status": "error",
              "value": "existing-team-member@launchdarkly.com"
            },
            {
              "message": "Line 4: invalid email formatting",
              "status": "error",
              "value": "invalid email format"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Message | Resolution
        --- | ---
        Empty row | This line is blank. Add an email address and try again.
        Duplicate entry | This email address appears in the file twice. Remove the email from the file and try again.
        Email already exists in the specified team | This member is already on your team. Remove the email from the file and try again.
        Invalid formatting | This email address is not formatted correctly. Fix the formatting and try again.
        Email does not belong to a LaunchDarkly member | The email address doesn't belong to a LaunchDarkly account member. Invite them to LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team.

        On a `400` response, the `message` field may contain errors specific to this endpoint.

        Example `400` response:
        ```json
        {
          "code": "invalid_request",
          "message": "Unable to process file"
        }
        ```

        Message | Resolution
        --- | ---
        Unable to process file | LaunchDarkly could not process the file for an unspecified reason. Review your file for errors and try again.
        File exceeds 25mb | Break up your file into multiple files of less than 25mbs each.
        All emails have invalid formatting | None of the email addresses in the file are in the correct format. Fix the formatting and try again.
        All emails belong to existing team members | All listed members are already on this team. Populate the file with member emails that do not belong to the team and try again.
        File is empty | The CSV file does not contain any email addresses. Populate the file and try again.
        No emails belong to members of your LaunchDarkly organization | None of the email addresses belong to members of your LaunchDarkly account. Invite these members to LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team.

    put:
      description: |
        Enable or disable a feature flag for a user based on their key.

        To change the setting, send a `PUT` request to this URL with a request body containing the flag value. For example, to disable the sort.order flag for the user `test@test.com`, send a `PUT` to
        `https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/users/default/production/test@test.com/flags/sort.order` with the following body:

        ```json
        {
          "setting": false
        }
        ```

        Omitting the setting attribute, or a setting of null, in your `PUT` "clears" the current setting for a user.

        If you previously patched the flag, and the patch included the user's data, LaunchDarkly continues to use that data. If LaunchDarkly has never encountered the user's key before, it calculates the flag values based on the user key alone.
