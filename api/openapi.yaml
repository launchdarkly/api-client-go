  description: "# Overview\n\n## Authentication\n\nAll REST API resources are authenticated\
    \ with either [personal or service access tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens),\
    \ or session cookies. Other authentication mechanisms are not supported. You can\
    \ manage personal access tokens on your [Account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens)\
    \ page.\n\nLaunchDarkly also has SDK keys, mobile keys, and client-side IDs that\
    \ are used by our server-side SDKs, mobile SDKs, and client-side SDKs, respectively.\
    \ **These keys cannot be used to access our REST API**. These keys are environment-specific,\
    \ and can only perform read-only operations (fetching feature flag settings).\n\

    \ tokens should _never_ be exposed in untrusted contexts. Never put an access\
    \ token in client-side JavaScript, or embed it in a mobile application. LaunchDarkly\
    \ has special mobile keys that you can embed in mobile apps. If you accidentally\
    \ expose an access token or SDK key, you can reset it from your [Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/tokens)\
    \ page.\n>\n> The client-side ID is safe to embed in untrusted contexts. It's\
    \ designed for use in client-side JavaScript.\n\n### Via request header\n\nThe\
    \ preferred way to authenticate with the API is by adding an `Authorization` header\
    \ containing your access token to your requests. The value of the `Authorization`\
    \ header must be your access token.\n\nManage personal access tokens from the\
    \ [Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\n\n###\
    \ Via session cookie\n\nFor testing purposes, you can make API calls directly\
    \ from your web browser. If you're logged in to the application, the API will\
    \ use your existing session to authenticate calls.\n\nIf you have a [role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/built-in-roles)\
    \ other than Admin, or have a [custom role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/custom-roles)\
    \ defined, you may not have permission to perform some API calls. You will receive\
    \ a `401` response code in that case.\n\n> ### Modifying the Origin header causes\
    \ an error\n>\n> LaunchDarkly validates that the Origin header for any API request\
    \ authenticated by a session cookie matches the expected Origin header. The expected\
    \ Origin header is `https://app.launchdarkly.com`.\n>\n> If the Origin header\
    \ does not match what's expected, LaunchDarkly returns an error. This error can\
    \ prevent the LaunchDarkly app from working correctly.\n>\n> Any browser extension\
    \ that intentionally changes the Origin header can cause this problem. For example,\
    \ the `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` Chrome extension changes the Origin header\
    \ to `http://evil.com` and causes the app to fail.\n>\n> To prevent this error,\
    \ do not modify your Origin header.\n>\n> LaunchDarkly does not require origin\
    \ matching when authenticating with an access token, so this issue does not affect\
    \ normal API usage.\n\n## Representations\n\nAll resources expect and return JSON\
    \ response bodies. Error responses will also send a JSON body. Read [Errors](#section/Errors)\
    \ for a more detailed description of the error format used by the API.\n\nIn practice\
    \ this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type` header set to\
    \ `application/json`.\n\nIn addition, request bodies for `PUT`, `POST`, `REPORT`\
    \ and `PATCH` requests must be encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header set\
    \ to `application/json`.\n\n### Summary and detailed representations\n\nWhen you\
    \ fetch a list of resources, the response includes only the most important attributes\
    \ of each resource. This is a _summary representation_ of the resource. When you\
    \ fetch an individual resource, such as a single feature flag, you receive a _detailed\
    \ representation_ of the resource.\n\nThe best way to find a detailed representation\
    \ is to follow links. Every summary representation includes a link to its detailed\
    \ representation.\n\nIn most cases, the detailed representation contains all of\
    \ the attributes of the resource. In a few cases, the detailed representation\
    \ contains many, but not all, of the attributes of the resource. Typically this\
    \ happens when an attribute of the requested resource is itself paginated. You\
    \ can request that the response include a particular attribute by using the `expand`\
    \ request parameter.\n\n### Links and addressability\n\nThe best way to navigate\
    \ the API is by following links. These are attributes in representations that\
    \ link to other resources. The API always uses the same format for links:\n\n\
    - Links to other resources within the API are encapsulated in a `_links` object.\n\
    - If the resource has a corresponding link to HTML content on the site, it is\
    \ stored in a special `_site` link.\n\nEach link has two attributes: an href (the\
    \ URL) and a type (the content type). For example, a feature resource might return\
    \ the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"parent\": {\n      \"href\"\
    : \"/api/features\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"self\"\
    : {\n      \"href\": \"/api/features/sort.order\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\
    \n    }\n  },\n  \"_site\": {\n    \"href\": \"/features/sort.order\",\n    \"\
    type\": \"text/html\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom this, you can navigate to the parent\
    \ collection of features by following the `parent` link, or navigate to the site\
    \ page for the feature by following the `_site` link.\n\nCollections are always\
    \ represented as a JSON object with an `items` attribute containing an array of\
    \ representations. Like all other representations, collections have `_links` defined\
    \ at the top level.\n\nPaginated collections include `first`, `last`, `next`,\
    \ and `prev` links containing a URL with the respective set of elements in the\
    \ collection.\n\n### Expanding responses\n\nSometimes the detailed representation\
    \ of a resource does not include all of the attributes of the resource by default.\
    \ If this is the case, the request method will clearly document this and describe\
    \ which attributes you can include in an expanded response.\n\nTo include the\
    \ additional attributes, append the `expand` request parameter to your request\
    \ and add a comma-separated list of the attributes to include. For example, when\
    \ you append `?expand=members,roles` to the [Get team](/tag/Teams-(beta)#operation/getTeam)\
    \ endpoint, the expanded response includes both of these attributes.\n\n## Updates\n\
    \nResources that accept partial updates use the `PATCH` verb. Most resources support\
    \ the [JSON Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) format. Some\
    \ resources also support the [JSON Merge Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386)\
    \ format, and some resources support the [semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch)\
    \ format, which is a way to specify the modifications to perform as a set of executable\
    \ instructions. Each resource supports optional [comments](/reference#updates-with-comments)\
    \ that you can submit with updates. Comments appear in outgoing webhooks, the\
    \ audit log, and other integrations.\n\n### Updates using JSON patch\n\n[JSON\
    \ Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) is a way to specify the\
    \ modifications to perform on a resource. JSON patch uses paths and a limited\
    \ set of operations to describe how to transform the current state of the resource\
    \ into a new state. JSON patch documents are always arrays, where each element\
    \ contains an operation, a path to the field to update, and the new value.\n\n\
    For example, in this feature flag representation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\"\
    : \"New recommendations engine\",\n    \"key\": \"engine.enable\",\n    \"description\"\
    : \"This is the description\",\n    ...\n}\n```\nYou can change the feature flag's\
    \ description with the following patch document:\n\n```json\n[{ \"op\": \"replace\"\
    , \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"This is the new description\" }]\n\
    ```\n\nYou can specify multiple modifications to perform in a single request.\
    \ You can also test that certain preconditions are met before applying the patch:\n\
    \n```json\n[\n  { \"op\": \"test\", \"path\": \"/version\", \"value\": 10 },\n\
    \  { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"The new description\"\
    \ }\n]\n```\n\nThe above patch request tests whether the feature flag's `version`\
    \ is `10`, and if so, changes the feature flag's description.\n\nAttributes that\
    \ aren't editable, like a resource's `_links`, have names that start with an underscore.\n\
    \n### Updates using JSON merge patch\n\n[JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386)\
    \ is another format for specifying the modifications to perform on a resource.\
    \ JSON merge patch is less expressive than JSON patch but in many cases, it is\
    \ simpler to construct a merge patch document. For example, you can change a feature\
    \ flag's description with the following merge patch document:\n\n```json\n{\n\
    \  \"description\": \"New flag description\"\n}\n```\n\n### Updates using semantic\
    \ patch\n\nThe API also supports the semantic patch format. A semantic `PATCH`\
    \ is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource as a set of executable\
    \ instructions.\n\nSemantic patch allows you to be explicit about intent using\
    \ precise, custom instructions. In many cases, you can define semantic patch instructions\
    \ independently of the current state of the resource. This can be useful when\
    \ defining a change that may be applied at a future date.\n\nTo make a semantic\
    \ patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to\
    \ your `Content-Type` header.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```\nContent-Type: application/json;\
    \ domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch\n```\n\nIf you call a semantic patch\
    \ resource without this header, you will receive a `400` response because your\
    \ semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON patch.\n\nThe body of a semantic\
    \ patch request takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional)\
    \ A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some\
    \ resources only) The environment key.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A\
    \ list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an\
    \ object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action\
    \ requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields\
    \ in the object. The documentation for each resource that supports semantic patch\
    \ includes the available instructions and any additional parameters.\n\nFor example:\n\
    \n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [ {\"\
    kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"} ]\n}\n```\n\nIf any instruction in the patch encounters\
    \ an error, the endpoint returns an error and will not change the resource. In\
    \ general, each instruction silently does nothing if the resource is already in\
    \ the state you request.\n\n> ### Supported semantic patch API endpoints\n>\n\

    \nYou can submit optional comments with `PATCH` changes.\n\nTo submit a comment\
    \ along with a JSON Patch document, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n\
    \  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"patch\": [{ \"op\": \"replace\"\
    , \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"The new description\" }]\n}\n```\n\n\
    To submit a comment along with a JSON merge patch document, use the following\
    \ format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"merge\"\
    : { \"description\": \"New flag description\" }\n}\n```\n\nTo submit a comment\
    \ along with a semantic patch, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\"\
    : \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"instructions\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"\
    } ]\n}\n```\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API always returns errors in a common format.\
    \ Here's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"code\": \"invalid_request\",\n  \"message\"\
    : \"A feature with that key already exists\",\n  \"id\": \"30ce6058-87da-11e4-b116-123b93f75cba\"\
    \n}\n```\n\nThe general class of error is indicated by the `code`. The `message`\
    \ is a human-readable explanation of what went wrong. The `id` is a unique identifier.\
    \ Use it when you're working with LaunchDarkly support to debug a problem with\
    \ a specific API call.\n\n### HTTP Status - Error Response Codes\n\n| Code | Definition\
    \        | Description                                                       \
    \                                | Possible Solution                         \

    \            |\n| 401  | Invalid access token      | User is unauthorized or does\

    \           |\n\n## CORS\n\nThe LaunchDarkly API supports Cross Origin Resource\
    \ Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. If an `Origin` header is given\
    \ in a request, it will be echoed as an explicitly allowed origin. Otherwise,\
    \ a wildcard is returned: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. For more information\
    \ on CORS, see the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors). Example\
    \ CORS headers might look like:\n\n```http\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept,\
    \ Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods:\
    \ OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAccess-Control-Max-Age:\
    \ 300\n```\n\nYou can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin\
    \ calls, using either [token or session-based authentication](#section/Authentication).\
    \ If you’re using session auth, you should set the `withCredentials` property\
    \ for your `xhr` request to `true`. You should never expose your access tokens\
    \ to untrusted users.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nWe use several rate limiting strategies\
    \ to ensure the availability of our APIs. Rate-limited calls to our APIs will\
    \ return a `429` status code. Calls to our APIs will include headers indicating\
    \ the current rate limit status. The specific headers returned depend on the API\
    \ route being called. The limits differ based on the route, authentication mechanism,\
    \ and other factors. Routes that are not rate limited may not contain any of the\
    \ headers described below.\n\n> ### Rate limiting and SDKs\n>\n> LaunchDarkly\
    \ SDKs are never rate limited and do not use the API endpoints defined here. LaunchDarkly\
    \ uses a different set of approaches, including streaming/server-sent events and\
    \ a global CDN, to ensure availability to the routes used by LaunchDarkly SDKs.\n\
    \n### Global rate limits\n\nAuthenticated requests are subject to a global limit.\
    \ This is the maximum number of calls that can be made to the API per ten seconds.\
    \ All personal access tokens on the account share this limit, so exceeding the\
    \ limit with one access token will impact other tokens. Calls that are subject\
    \ to global rate limits will return the headers below:\n\n| Header name      \
    \              | Description                                                 \
    \                     |\n| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Global-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests the account\
    \ is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`            |\
    \ The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.\
    \    |\n\nWe do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be\
    \ made globally. This limit may change, and we encourage clients to program against\
    \ the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding\
    \ to the current limit.\n\n### Route-level rate limits\n\nSome authenticated routes\
    \ have custom rate limits. These also reset every ten seconds. Any access tokens\
    \ hitting the same route share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access\
    \ token may impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to route-level rate limits\
    \ will return the headers below:\n\n| Header name                   | Description\
    \                                                                            \
    \               |\n| ----------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Route-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests to the current\
    \ route the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`\
    \           | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch\
    \ milliseconds.                         |\n\nA _route_ represents a specific URL\
    \ pattern and verb. For example, the [Delete environment](/tag/Environments#operation/deleteEnvironment)\
    \ endpoint is considered a single route, and each call to delete an environment\
    \ counts against your route-level rate limit for that route.\n\nWe do not publicly\
    \ document the specific number of calls that can be made to each endpoint per\
    \ ten seconds. These limits may change, and we encourage clients to program against\
    \ the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding\
    \ to the current limits.\n\n### IP-based rate limiting\n\nWe also employ IP-based\
    \ rate limiting on some API routes. If you hit an IP-based rate limit, your API\
    \ response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before\
    \ re-trying the call. Clients must wait at least `Retry-After` seconds before\
    \ making additional calls to our API, and should employ jitter and backoff strategies\
    \ to avoid triggering rate limits again.\n\n## OpenAPI (Swagger)\n\nWe have a\
    \ [complete OpenAPI (Swagger) specification](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/openapi.json)\
    \ for our API.\n\nYou can use this specification to generate client libraries\
    \ to interact with our REST API in your language of choice.\n\nThis specification\
    \ is supported by several API-based tools such as Postman and Insomnia. In many\
    \ cases, you can directly import our specification to ease use in navigating the\
    \ APIs in the tooling.\n\n## Client libraries\n\nWe auto-generate multiple client\
    \ libraries based on our OpenAPI specification. To learn more, visit [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-api+org%3Alaunchdarkly&type=Repositories).\n\
    \n## Method Overriding\n\nSome firewalls and HTTP clients restrict the use of\
    \ verbs other than `GET` and `POST`. In those environments, our API endpoints\
    \ that use `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` verbs will be inaccessible.\n\nTo avoid\
    \ this issue, our API supports the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, allowing clients\
    \ to \"tunnel\" `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests via a `POST` request.\n\n\
    For example, if you wish to call one of our `PATCH` resources via a `POST` request,\
    \ you can include `X-HTTP-Method-Override:PATCH` as a header.\n\n## Beta resources\n\
    \nWe sometimes release new API resources in **beta** status before we release\
    \ them with general availability.\n\nResources that are in beta are still undergoing\
    \ testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming\
    \ backwards incompatible.\n\nWe try to promote resources into general availability\
    \ as quickly as possible. This happens after sufficient testing and when we're\
    \ satisfied that we no longer need to make backwards-incompatible changes.\n\n\
    We mark beta resources with a \"Beta\" callout in our documentation, pictured\
    \ below:\n\n> ### This feature is in beta\n>\n> To use this feature, pass in a\
    \ header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`. Use this\
    \ header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](/#section/Overview/Beta-resources).\n\
    \n### Using beta resources\n\nTo use a beta resource, you must include a header\
    \ in the request. If you call a beta resource without this header, you'll receive\
    \ a `403` response.\n\nUse this header:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: beta\n```\n\n\
    ## Versioning\n\nWe try hard to keep our REST API backwards compatible, but we\
    \ occasionally have to make backwards-incompatible changes in the process of shipping\
    \ new features. These breaking changes can cause unexpected behavior if you don't\
    \ prepare for them accordingly.\n\nUpdates to our REST API include support for\
    \ the latest features in LaunchDarkly. We also release a new version of our REST\
    \ API every time we make a breaking change. We provide simultaneous support for\
    \ multiple API versions so you can migrate from your current API version to a\
    \ new version at your own pace.\n\n### Setting the API version per request\n\n\
    You can set the API version on a specific request by sending an `LD-API-Version`\
    \ header, as shown in the example below:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: 20220603\n```\n\
    \nThe header value is the version number of the API version you'd like to request.\
    \ The number for each version corresponds to the date the version was released\
    \ in yyyymmdd format. In the example above the version `20220603` corresponds\
    \ to June 03, 2022.\n\n### Setting the API version per access token\n\nWhen creating\
    \ an access token, you must specify a specific version of the API to use. This\
    \ ensures that integrations using this token cannot be broken by version changes.\n\
    \nTokens created before versioning was released have their version set to `20160426`\
    \ (the version of the API that existed before versioning) so that they continue\
    \ working the same way they did before versioning.\n\nIf you would like to upgrade\
    \ your integration to use a new API version, you can explicitly set the header\
    \ described above.\n\n> ### Best practice: Set the header for every client or\
    \ integration\n>\n> We recommend that you set the API version header explicitly\
    \ in any client or integration you build.\n>\n> Only rely on the access token\
    \ API version during manual testing.\n\n### API version changelog\n\n|<div style=\"\

    \nTo manage legacy experiments, make the following PATCH requests to the flags\
    \ API:\n\n#### Adding an experiment\n\nTo add an experiment to a flag, add a new\
    \ object to the `/experiments/items/` property.\n\nThe object must contain:\n\n\
    1. The key of the metric you want to use for the experiment.\n2. (Optional) A\
    \ list of keys for the environments where the experiment should record data.\n\
    \n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n[\n    {\n        \"op\":\

    : []\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### Removing an experiment\n\nTo remove an\
    \ experiment, remove the corresponding item from the experiments or items property.\n\
    \n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n[\n    {\n        \"op\":\
    \ \"remove\",\n        \"path\": \"/experiments/items/0\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n####\
    \ Starting or resuming an experiment\n\nTo start recording data for an experiment\
    \ in an environment, add the environment key to the list of environments for that\
    \ experiment.\n\n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n[\n    {\n\
    \        \"op\": \"add\",\n        \"path\": \"/experiments/items/0/environments/0\"\
    ,\n        \"value\": \"production\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### Stopping an experiment\n\
    \nTo stop collecting data for an experiment in a specific environment, remove\
    \ the environment from the list that experiment uses.\n\n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n\
    [\n  {\n    \"op\": \"remove\",\n    \"path\": \"/experiments/items/0/environments/0\"\
    \n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Updating the baseline\n\nTo update the baseline for all\
    \ experiments on a flag across all environments in the project, replace the `baselineIdx`\
    \ property with the index of the new baseline variation.\n\n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n\
    [\n  {\n    \"op\": \"replace\",\n    \"path\": \"/experiments/baselineIdx\",\n\

- description: "## Anatomy of a feature flag\n\nThe feature flag API allows you to\
    \ control percentage rollouts, target specific users, or even toggle off a feature\
    \ programmatically. By looking at the representation of a feature flag, we can\
    \ see how to do any of these tasks.\n\n## Sample feature flag representation\n\
    \nEvery feature flag has a set of top-level attributes, as well as an `environments`\
    \ map containing the flag rollout and targeting rules specific to each environment.\
    \ Top-level attributes include things like the flag's name, description, tags,\
    \ and creation date. To learn more, read [Using feature flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags).\n\

    \ of the top-level attributes have a straightforward interpretation. For example,\
    \ to change the name of a feature, [update the feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag)\
    \ with the `name` attribute set to the new name:\n\n```json\n[\n    { \"op\":\
    \ \"replace\", \"path\": \"/name\", \"value\": \"New name\" }\n]\n```\n\nThe `variations`\
    \ array represents the different variation values that a feature flag has. For\
    \ a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and `false`. Multivariate flags\
    \ have more variation values, and those values could be any JSON type: numbers,\
    \ strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting rules, the variations are referred\
    \ to by their index into this array. Below are some specific examples.\n\n## Per-environment\
    \ configurations\n\nEach entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object\
    \ that represents the environment-specific flag configuration data available in\
    \ the flag's Targeting tab. For example, to toggle off a feature flag in your\
    \ production environment, use the following JSON patch operation:\n\n```json\n\
    [\n    { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/environments/production/on\", \"value\"\
    : false }\n]\n```\n\nTo learn more, read [Targeting users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).\n\
    \nEach section of the Targeting tab corresponds to a different attribute of the\
    \ per-environment configuration data, as shown here:\n\n## Individual user targets\n\
    \nThe `targets` array in the per-environment configuration data represents the\
    \ individual user targeting rules on the Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Targeting\
    \ users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).\n\nEach object\
    \ in the `targets` array represents a list of user keys assigned to a particular\
    \ variation. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    ...\n    \"environments\" : {\n \
    \       \"production\" : {\n            ...\n            \"targets\": [\n    \
    \            {\n                    \"values\": [\"foo@example.com\"],\n     \
    \               \"variation: 0\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n\
    \    }\n}\n```\n\nThis `targets` array here means that user `foo@example.com`\
    \ receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. Recall that the\
    \ variations are stored at the top level of the flag JSON in an array, and the\
    \ per-environment configuration rules point to indexes into this array. If this\
    \ is a boolean flag, `foo@example.com` is receiving the `true` variation.\n\n\
    ## Targeting rules\n\nThe `rules` array corresponds to the custom targeting rules\
    \ section of the Targeting tab. This is where you can express complex rules on\
    \ attributes with conditions and operators. For example, a rule like \"roll out\
    \ the `true` variation to 80% of users whose email address ends with `gmail.com`\
    \ could be expressed here. To learn more, read [Creating targeting rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users#creating-targeting-rules).\n\
    \n## The fallthrough rule\n\nThe `fallthrough` object is a special rule that contains\
    \ no conditions. It is the rollout strategy that is applied when none of the individual\
    \ or custom targeting rules match.\n\n## The off variation\n\nThe off variation\
    \ represents the variation to serve if the feature flag is turned off, meaning\
    \ the `on` attribute is `false`. For boolean flags, this is usually `false`. For\
    \ multivariate flags, set the off variation to whatever variation represents the\
    \ control or baseline behavior for your application. If you don't set the off\
    \ variation, LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.\n\
    \n## Percentage rollouts\n\nThe `weight` attribute defines the percentage rollout\
    \ for each variation. Weights range from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout).\
    \ The weights are scaled by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can\
    \ be represented without using floating-point. For example, a weight of `50000`\
    \ means that 50% of users that don't otherwise match any `targets` will see that\
    \ variation. The sum of weights across all variations should be 100%.\n"

    \ To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).\n\
    \nA workflow is a set of actions that you can schedule in advance to make changes\
    \ to a feature flag at a future date and time. You can also include approval requests\
    \ at different stages of a workflow. To learn more, read [Workflows](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows).\n\
    \nThe actions supported are as follows:\n\n- Turning targeting `ON` or `OFF`\n\
    - Setting the default variation\n- Creating a rule to target a group of users\
    \ by segment\n- Modifying the rollout percentage for rules\n\nYou can create multiple\
    \ stages of a flag release workflow. Unique stages are defined by their conditions:\
    \ either approvals and/or scheduled changes.\n"

      - Feature flags
  /api/v2/flags/{projectKey}:
    get:
      description: "Get a list of all features in the given project. By default, each\
        \ feature includes configurations for each environment. You can filter environments\
        \ with the env query parameter. For example, setting `env=production` restricts\
        \ the returned configurations to just your production environment. You can\
        \ also filter feature flags by tag with the tag query parameter.\n\nWe support\
        \ the following fields for filters:\n\n- `query` is a string that matches\
        \ against the flags' keys and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `archived`\
        \ is a boolean to filter the list to archived flags. When this is absent,\
        \ only unarchived flags are returned.\n- `type` is a string allowing filtering\
        \ to `temporary` or `permanent` flags.\n- `status` is a string allowing filtering\
        \ to `new`, `inactive`, `active`, or `launched` flags in the specified environment.\
        \ This filter also requires a `filterEnv` field to be set to a valid environment.\
        \ For example: `filter=status:active,filterEnv:production`.\n- `tags` is a\
        \ + separated list of tags. It filters the list to members who have all of\
        \ the tags in the list.\n- `hasExperiment` is a boolean with values of true\
        \ or false and returns any flags that have an attached metric.\n- `hasDataExport`\
        \ is a boolean with values of true or false and returns any flags that are\
        \ exporting data in the specified environment. This includes flags that are\
        \ exporting data from Experimentation. This filter also requires that you\
        \ set a `filterEnv` field to a valid environment key. For example: `filter=hasDataExport:true,filterEnv:production`\n\
        - `evaluated` is an object that contains a key of `after` and a value in Unix\
        \ time in milliseconds. This returns all flags that have been evaluated since\
        \ the time you specify in the environment provided. This filter also requires\
        \ you to set a `filterEnv` field to a valid environment. For example: `filter=evaluated:{\"\
        after\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production`.\n- `filterEnv` is a string\
        \ with the key of a valid environment. You can use the filterEnv field for\
        \ filters that are environment-specific. If there are multiple environment-specific\
        \ filters, you should only declare this parameter once. For example: `filter=evaluated:{\"\
        after\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production,status:active`.\n\nAn example\
        \ filter is `query:abc,tags:foo+bar`. This matches flags with the string `abc`\
        \ in their key or name, ignoring case, which also have the tags `foo` and\
        \ `bar`.\n\nBy default, this returns all flags. You can page through the list\
        \ with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`,\
        \ and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links will not be\
        \ present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first`\
        \ and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.\n"

    patch:
      description: "Perform a partial update to a feature flag. The request body must\
        \ be a valid semantic patch or JSON patch.\n\n## Using semantic patches on\
        \ a feature flag\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nThe body of a semantic\
        \ patch request for updating feature flags requires an `environmentKey` in\
        \ addition to `instructions` and an optional `comment`. The body of the request\
        \ takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description\
        \ of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly\
        \ environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the\
        \ update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a\
        \ `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters,\
        \ you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object.\n\n\
        ### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions\
        \ for updating feature flags.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions\
        \ for turning flags on and off</summary>\n\n#### turnFlagOff\n\nSets the flag's\
        \ targeting state to **Off**.\n\nFor example, to turn a flag off, use this\

        ,\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnFlagOn\n\
        \nSets the flag's targeting state to **On**.\n\nFor example, to turn a flag\
        \ on, use this request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"example-environment-key\"\
        ,\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n</details><br\
        \ />\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for working with\

        \n## Using JSON Patches on a feature flag\nIf you do not include the header\
        \ described above, you can use [JSON patch](/reference#updates-using-json-patch).\n\
        \nWhen using the update feature flag endpoint to add individual users to a\
        \ specific variation, there are two different patch documents, depending on\
        \ whether users are already being individually targeted for the variation.\n\
        \nIf a flag variation already has users individually targeted, the path for\
        \ the JSON Patch operation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"op\": \"add\",\n  \"path\"\
        : \"/environments/devint/targets/0/values/-\",\n  \"value\": \"TestClient10\"\
        \n}\n```\n\nIf a flag variation does not already have users individually targeted,\
        \ the path for the JSON Patch operation is:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"op\"\
        : \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/-\",\n    \"value\"\
        : { \"variation\": 0, \"values\": [\"TestClient10\"] }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n\n\
        ## Required approvals\nIf a request attempts to alter a flag configuration\
        \ in an environment where approvals are required for the flag, the request\
        \ will fail with a 405. Changes to the flag configuration in that environment\
        \ will require creating an [approval request](/tag/Approvals) or a [workflow](/tag/Workflows-(beta)).\n\
        \n## Conflicts\nIf a flag configuration change made through this endpoint\
        \ would cause a pending scheduled change or approval request to fail, this\
        \ endpoint will return a 400. You can ignore this check by adding an `ignoreConflicts`\
        \ query parameter set to `true`.\n"

      description: "Schedule a user for removal from individual targeting on a feature\
        \ flag. The flag must already individually target the user.\n\nYou can add,\
        \ update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only schedule a user\
        \ for removal on a single variation per flag.\n\nThis request only supports\
        \ semantic patches. To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        #### addExpireUserTargetDate\n\nAdds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will\
        \ remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove\
        \ the user from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`: The version\
        \ of the flag variation to update. You can retrieve this by making a GET request\
        \ for the flag.\n* `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual\
        \ targeting\n\n#### updateExpireUserTargetDate\n\nUpdates the date and time\
        \ that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly\
        \ should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`:\
        \ The version of the flag variation to update. You can retrieve this by making\
        \ a GET request for the flag.\n* `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove\
        \ from individual targeting\n\n#### removeExpireUserTargetDate\n\nRemoves\
        \ the scheduled removal of the user from the flag's individual targeting.\
        \ The user will remain part of the flag's individual targeting until you explicitly\
        \ remove them, or until you schedule another removal.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n* `variationId`: The version of the flag variation to update. You can retrieve\
        \ this by making a GET request for the flag.\n* `userKey`: The user key for\

    patch:
      description: "Update a flag trigger. Updating a flag trigger uses the semantic\
        \ patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating\
        \ flag triggers.\n\n#### replaceTriggerActionInstructions\n\nRemoves the existing\
        \ trigger action and replaces it with the new instructions.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n- `value`: An array of the new `kind`s of actions to perform when triggering.\
        \ Supported flag actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.\n\nFor example,\
        \ to replace the trigger action instructions, use this request body:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"comment\": \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [\n    {\n  \
        \    \"kind\": \"replaceTriggerActionInstructions\",\n      \"value\": [ {\"\
        kind\": \"turnFlagOff\"} ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### cycleTriggerUrl\n\n\
        Generates a new URL for this trigger. You must update any clients using the\
        \ trigger to use this new URL.\n\n#### disableTrigger\n\nDisables the trigger.\
        \ This saves the trigger configuration, but the trigger stops running. To\
        \ re-enable, use `enableTrigger`.\n\n#### enableTrigger\n\nEnables the trigger.\
        \ If you previously disabled the trigger, it begins running again.\n"

    get:
      description: "Return a list of account members.\n\nBy default, this returns\
        \ the first 20 members. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter\
        \ and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned\
        \ `_links` field. These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't\
        \ exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the\
        \ response on the first page.\n\n### Filtering members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports\
        \ three fields for filters: `query`, `role`, and `lastSeen`:\n\n- `query`\
        \ is a string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not\
        \ case sensitive.\n- `role` is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles.\
        \ It filters the list to members who have any of the roles in the list. For\
        \ the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.\n- `team` is\
        \ a string that matches against the key of the teams the members belong to.\
        \ It is not case sensitive.\n- `lastSeen` is a JSON object in one of the following\
        \ formats:\n  - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that have never been active,\
        \ such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or\
        \ have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.\n  - `{\"noData\":\
        \ true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording\
        \ last seen timestamps.\n  - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}` - Members that\
        \ have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp\
        \ in Unix epoch milliseconds.\n\nFor example, the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole`\
        \ matches members with the string `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case,\
        \ who also are either an an `Owner` or `Admin` or have the custom role `customrole`.\n\
        \n### Sorting members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName`\
        \ and `lastSeen`:\n\n- `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the\
        \ member's email if no name is set.\n- `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen`\
        \ property. LaunchDarkly considers members that have never been seen or have\
        \ no data the oldest.\n"

        \ the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that\

        \ For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response\

        \ to the first page when you are already on the first page.\n\n### Filtering\
        \ projects\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:\n- `query` is\
        \ a string that matches against the projects' names and keys. It is not case\
        \ sensitive.\n- `tags` is a `+` separate list of project tags. It filters\
        \ the list of projects that have all of the tags in the list.\n\nFor example,\
        \ the filter `query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches projects with the string\
        \ `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`.\
        \ The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\n### Sorting projects\n\nLaunchDarkly\
        \ supports two fields for sorting:\n- `name` sorts by project name.\n- `createdOn`\
        \ sorts by the creation date of the project.\n\nFor example, `sort=name` sorts\
        \ the response by project name in ascending order.\n\n### Expanding the projects\
        \ response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the \"List projects\"\
        \ response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\
        \nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated\
        \ list with the `environments` field.\n\n`Environments` includes a paginated\
        \ list of the project environments.\n* `environments` includes a paginated\
        \ list of the project environments.\n\nFor example, `expand=environments`\
        \ includes the `environments` field for each project in the response.\n"

        \ iteration will be included in the response.\n- `draftIteration` includes\
        \ a draft of an iteration which has not been started yet, if any.\n- `secondaryMetrics`\
        \ includes secondary metrics.  By default only the primary metric is included\
        \ in the response.\n- `treatments` includes all treatment and parameter details.\

    patch:
      description: "\nUpdate a scheduled change, overriding existing instructions\
        \ with the new ones. Updating a scheduled change uses the semantic patch format.\n\
        \nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating\
        \ scheduled changes.\n\n#### deleteScheduledChange\n\nRemoves the scheduled\
        \ change.\n\n#### replaceScheduledChangesInstructions\n\nRemoves the existing\
        \ scheduled changes and replaces them with the new instructions.\n\n#####\
        \ Parameters\n\n- `value`: An array of the new actions to perform when the\
        \ execution date for these scheduled changes arrives. Supported scheduled\
        \ actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.\n\nFor example, to replace the\
        \ scheduled changes, use this request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\":\
        \ \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [\n    {\n      \"kind\": \"\
        replaceScheduledChangesInstructions\",\n      \"value\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\"\
        } ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateScheduledChangesExecutionDate\n\nUpdates\
        \ the execution date for the scheduled changes.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`:\
        \ the new execution date, in Unix milliseconds.\n"

        \ for updating segments.\n\n#### addIncludedUsers\n\nAdds user keys to the\
        \ individual user targets included in the segment. Returns an error if this\
        \ causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### addExcludedUsers\n\nAdds user keys\
        \ to the individual user targets excluded from the segment. Returns an error\
        \ if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.\n\n#####\
        \ Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### removeIncludedUsers\n\
        \nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets included in the segment.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### removeExcludedUsers\n\
        \nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets excluded from the segment.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### updateName\n\n\
        Updates the name of the segment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Name of\
        \ the segment.\n\n## Using JSON patches on a segment\n\nYou can also use JSON\
        \ patch. To learn more, read [Updates using JSON patches](/reference#updates-using-json-patch).\n\
        \nFor example, to update the description for a segment, use the following\
        \ request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"replace\"\
        ,\n      \"path\": \"/description\",\n      \"value\": \"new description\"\
        \n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo update fields in the segment that are arrays, set\
        \ the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Using\
        \ `/0` adds the new entry to the beginning of the array.\n\nFor example, to\
        \ add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:\n\n```json\n{\n\
        \  \"patch\":[\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/rules/0\"\
        ,\n      \"value\": {\n        \"clauses\": [{ \"attribute\": \"email\", \"\
        op\": \"endsWith\", \"values\": [\".edu\"], \"negate\": false }]\n      }\n\
        \    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo add or remove users from segments, we recommend\
        \ using semantic patch. Semantic patch for segments includes specific `instructions`\
        \ for adding and removing both included and excluded users.\n"

    patch:
      description: "Perform a partial update to a team. Updating a team uses the semantic\
        \ patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating\
        \ teams.\n\n#### addCustomRoles\n\nAdds custom roles to the team. Team members\
        \ will have these custom roles granted to them.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`:\
        \ List of custom role keys.\n\n#### removeCustomRoles\n\nRemoves custom roles\
        \ from the team. The app will no longer grant these custom roles to the team\
        \ members.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of custom role keys.\n\n\
        #### addMembers\n\nAdds members to the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`:\
        \ List of member IDs.\n\n#### removeMembers\n\nRemoves members from the team.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of member IDs.\n\n#### addPermissionGrants\n\
        \nAdds permission grants to members for the team. For example, a permission\
        \ grant could allow a member to act as a team maintainer. A permission grant\
        \ may have either an `actionSet` or a list of `actions` but not both at the\
        \ same time. The members do not have to be team members to have a permission\
        \ grant for the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `actionSet`: Name of the action\
        \ set.\n- `actions`: List of actions.\n- `memberIDs`: List of member IDs.\n\
        \n#### removePermissionGrants\n\nRemoves permission grants from members for\
        \ the team. The `actionSet` and `actions` must match an existing permission\
        \ grant.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `actionSet`: Name of the action set.\n-\
        \ `actions`: List of actions.\n- `memberIDs`: List of member IDs.\n\n####\
        \ updateDescription\n\nUpdates the description of the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n- `value`: The new description.\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates the name of\
        \ the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new name.\n\n### Expanding\
        \ the teams response\nLaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the\
        \ \"Update team\" response. By default, these fields are **not** included\
        \ in the response.\n\nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter\

        \ includes the total count of members that belong to the team.\n* `roles`\
        \ includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to\
        \ the team.\n* `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the\
        \ team has any write access to.\n* `maintainers` includes a paginated list\
        \ of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.\n\nFor example, `expand=members,roles`\
