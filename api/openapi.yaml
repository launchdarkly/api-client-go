  description: "# Overview\n\n## Authentication\n\nAll REST API resources are authenticated\
    \ with either [personal or service access tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens),\
    \ or session cookies. Other authentication mechanisms are not supported. You can\
    \ manage personal access tokens on your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens)\
    \ page.\n\nLaunchDarkly also has SDK keys, mobile keys, and client-side IDs that\
    \ are used by our server-side SDKs, mobile SDKs, and JavaScript-based SDKs, respectively.\
    \ **These keys cannot be used to access our REST API**. These keys are environment-specific,\
    \ and can only perform read-only operations such as fetching feature flag settings.\n\
    \n| Auth mechanism                                                           \

    \                             |\n\n> #### Keep your access tokens and SDK keys\
    \ private\n>\n> Access tokens should _never_ be exposed in untrusted contexts.\
    \ Never put an access token in client-side JavaScript, or embed it in a mobile\
    \ application. LaunchDarkly has special mobile keys that you can embed in mobile\
    \ apps. If you accidentally expose an access token or SDK key, you can reset it\
    \ from your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens)\
    \ page.\n>\n> The client-side ID is safe to embed in untrusted contexts. It's\
    \ designed for use in client-side JavaScript.\n\n### Authentication using request\
    \ header\n\nThe preferred way to authenticate with the API is by adding an `Authorization`\
    \ header containing your access token to your requests. The value of the `Authorization`\
    \ header must be your access token.\n\nManage personal access tokens from the\
    \ [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\n\
    \n### Authentication using session cookie\n\nFor testing purposes, you can make\
    \ API calls directly from your web browser. If you are logged in to the LaunchDarkly\
    \ application, the API will use your existing session to authenticate calls.\n\
    \nIf you have a [role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/built-in-roles)\
    \ other than Admin, or have a [custom role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/custom-roles)\
    \ defined, you may not have permission to perform some API calls. You will receive\
    \ a `401` response code in that case.\n\n> ### Modifying the Origin header causes\
    \ an error\n>\n> LaunchDarkly validates that the Origin header for any API request\
    \ authenticated by a session cookie matches the expected Origin header. The expected\
    \ Origin header is `https://app.launchdarkly.com`.\n>\n> If the Origin header\
    \ does not match what's expected, LaunchDarkly returns an error. This error can\
    \ prevent the LaunchDarkly app from working correctly.\n>\n> Any browser extension\
    \ that intentionally changes the Origin header can cause this problem. For example,\
    \ the `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` Chrome extension changes the Origin header\
    \ to `http://evil.com` and causes the app to fail.\n>\n> To prevent this error,\
    \ do not modify your Origin header.\n>\n> LaunchDarkly does not require origin\
    \ matching when authenticating with an access token, so this issue does not affect\
    \ normal API usage.\n\n## Representations\n\nAll resources expect and return JSON\
    \ response bodies. Error responses also send a JSON body. To learn more about\
    \ the error format of the API, read [Errors](/#section/Overview/Errors).\n\nIn\
    \ practice this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type` header\
    \ set to `application/json`.\n\nIn addition, request bodies for `PATCH`, `POST`,\
    \ `PUT`, and `REPORT` requests must be encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header\
    \ set to `application/json`.\n\n### Summary and detailed representations\n\nWhen\
    \ you fetch a list of resources, the response includes only the most important\
    \ attributes of each resource. This is a _summary representation_ of the resource.\
    \ When you fetch an individual resource, such as a single feature flag, you receive\
    \ a _detailed representation_ of the resource.\n\nThe best way to find a detailed\
    \ representation is to follow links. Every summary representation includes a link\
    \ to its detailed representation.\n\n### Expanding responses\n\nSometimes the\
    \ detailed representation of a resource does not include all of the attributes\
    \ of the resource by default. If this is the case, the request method will clearly\
    \ document this and describe which attributes you can include in an expanded response.\n\
    \nTo include the additional attributes, append the `expand` request parameter\
    \ to your request and add a comma-separated list of the attributes to include.\
    \ For example, when you append `?expand=members,roles` to the [Get team](/tag/Teams#operation/getTeam)\
    \ endpoint, the expanded response includes both of these attributes.\n\n### Links\
    \ and addressability\n\nThe best way to navigate the API is by following links.\
    \ These are attributes in representations that link to other resources. The API\
    \ always uses the same format for links:\n\n- Links to other resources within\
    \ the API are encapsulated in a `_links` object\n- If the resource has a corresponding\
    \ link to HTML content on the site, it is stored in a special `_site` link\n\n\
    Each link has two attributes:\n\n- An `href`, which contains the URL\n- A `type`,\
    \ which describes the content type\n\nFor example, a feature resource might return\
    \ the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"parent\": {\n      \"href\"\
    : \"/api/features\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"self\"\
    : {\n      \"href\": \"/api/features/sort.order\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\
    \n    }\n  },\n  \"_site\": {\n    \"href\": \"/features/sort.order\",\n    \"\
    type\": \"text/html\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom this, you can navigate to the parent\
    \ collection of features by following the `parent` link, or navigate to the site\
    \ page for the feature by following the `_site` link.\n\nCollections are always\
    \ represented as a JSON object with an `items` attribute containing an array of\
    \ representations. Like all other representations, collections have `_links` defined\
    \ at the top level.\n\nPaginated collections include `first`, `last`, `next`,\
    \ and `prev` links containing a URL with the respective set of elements in the\
    \ collection.\n\n## Updates\n\nResources that accept partial updates use the `PATCH`\
    \ verb. Most resources support the [JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902)\
    \ format. Some resources also support the [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386)\
    \ format, and some resources support the [semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch)\
    \ format, which is a way to specify the modifications to perform as a set of executable\
    \ instructions. Each resource supports optional [comments](/reference#updates-with-comments)\
    \ that you can submit with updates. Comments appear in outgoing webhooks, the\
    \ audit log, and other integrations.\n\nWhen a resource supports both JSON patch\
    \ and semantic patch, we document both in the request method. However, the specific\
    \ request body fields and descriptions included in our documentation only match\
    \ one type of patch or the other.\n\n### Updates using JSON patch\n\n[JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902)\
    \ is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON patch uses\
    \ paths and a limited set of operations to describe how to transform the current\
    \ state of the resource into a new state. JSON patch documents are always arrays,\
    \ where each element contains an operation, a path to the field to update, and\
    \ the new value.\n\nFor example, in this feature flag representation:\n\n```json\n\
    {\n    \"name\": \"New recommendations engine\",\n    \"key\": \"engine.enable\"\
    ,\n    \"description\": \"This is the description\",\n    ...\n}\n```\nYou can\
    \ change the feature flag's description with the following patch document:\n\n\
    ```json\n[{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"This\
    \ is the new description\" }]\n```\n\nYou can specify multiple modifications to\
    \ perform in a single request. You can also test that certain preconditions are\
    \ met before applying the patch:\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"op\": \"test\", \"path\"\
    : \"/version\", \"value\": 10 },\n  { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\"\
    , \"value\": \"The new description\" }\n]\n```\n\nThe above patch request tests\
    \ whether the feature flag's `version` is `10`, and if so, changes the feature\
    \ flag's description.\n\nAttributes that are not editable, such as a resource's\
    \ `_links`, have names that start with an underscore.\n\n### Updates using JSON\
    \ merge patch\n\n[JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386)\
    \ is another format for specifying the modifications to perform on a resource.\
    \ JSON merge patch is less expressive than JSON patch. However, in many cases\
    \ it is simpler to construct a merge patch document. For example, you can change\
    \ a feature flag's description with the following merge patch document:\n\n```json\n\
    {\n  \"description\": \"New flag description\"\n}\n```\n\n### Updates using semantic\
    \ patch\n\nThe API also supports the semantic patch format. A semantic patch is\
    \ a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource as a set of executable\
    \ instructions.\n\nSemantic patch allows you to be explicit about intent using\
    \ precise, custom instructions. In many cases, you can define semantic patch instructions\
    \ independently of the current state of the resource. This can be useful when\
    \ defining a change that may be applied at a future date.\n\nTo make a semantic\
    \ patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to\
    \ your `Content-Type` header.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```\nContent-Type: application/json;\
    \ domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch\n```\n\nIf you call a semantic patch\
    \ resource without this header, you will receive a `400` response because your\
    \ semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON patch.\n\nThe body of a semantic\
    \ patch request takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional)\
    \ A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some\
    \ resources only) The environment key.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A\
    \ list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an\
    \ object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the instruction\
    \ requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields\
    \ in the object. The documentation for each resource that supports semantic patch\
    \ includes the available instructions and any additional parameters.\n\nFor example:\n\
    \n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [ {\"\
    kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"} ]\n}\n```\n\nIf any instruction in the patch encounters\
    \ an error, the endpoint returns an error and will not change the resource. In\
    \ general, each instruction silently does nothing if the resource is already in\
    \ the state you request.\n\n### Updates with comments\n\nYou can submit optional\
    \ comments with `PATCH` changes.\n\nTo submit a comment along with a JSON patch\
    \ document, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is\
    \ a comment string\",\n  \"patch\": [{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\"\
    , \"value\": \"The new description\" }]\n}\n```\n\nTo submit a comment along with\
    \ a JSON merge patch document, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\"\
    : \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"merge\": { \"description\": \"New flag description\"\
    \ }\n}\n```\n\nTo submit a comment along with a semantic patch, use the following\
    \ format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"instructions\"\
    : [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"} ]\n}\n```\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API always returns\
    \ errors in a common format. Here's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"code\": \"\
    invalid_request\",\n  \"message\": \"A feature with that key already exists\"\
    ,\n  \"id\": \"30ce6058-87da-11e4-b116-123b93f75cba\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `code` indicates\
    \ the general class of error. The `message` is a human-readable explanation of\
    \ what went wrong. The `id` is a unique identifier. Use it when you're working\
    \ with LaunchDarkly Support to debug a problem with a specific API call.\n\n###\

    \                                      |\n\n## CORS\n\nThe LaunchDarkly API supports\
    \ Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. If an\
    \ `Origin` header is given in a request, it will be echoed as an explicitly allowed\
    \ origin. Otherwise the request returns a wildcard, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:\
    \ *`. For more information on CORS, read the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors).\
    \ Example CORS headers might look like:\n\n```http\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers:\
    \ Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods:\
    \ OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAccess-Control-Max-Age:\
    \ 300\n```\n\nYou can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin\
    \ calls, using either [token or session-based authentication](/#section/Overview/Authentication).\
    \ If you are using session authentication, you should set the `withCredentials`\
    \ property for your `xhr` request to `true`. You should never expose your access\
    \ tokens to untrusted users.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nWe use several rate limiting\
    \ strategies to ensure the availability of our APIs. Rate-limited calls to our\
    \ APIs return a `429` status code. Calls to our APIs include headers indicating\
    \ the current rate limit status. The specific headers returned depend on the API\
    \ route being called. The limits differ based on the route, authentication mechanism,\
    \ and other factors. Routes that are not rate limited may not contain any of the\
    \ headers described below.\n\n> ### Rate limiting and SDKs\n>\n> LaunchDarkly\
    \ SDKs are never rate limited and do not use the API endpoints defined here. LaunchDarkly\
    \ uses a different set of approaches, including streaming/server-sent events and\
    \ a global CDN, to ensure availability to the routes used by LaunchDarkly SDKs.\n\
    \n### Global rate limits\n\nAuthenticated requests are subject to a global limit.\
    \ This is the maximum number of calls that your account can make to the API per\
    \ ten seconds. All personal access tokens on the account share this limit, so\
    \ exceeding the limit with one access token will impact other tokens. Calls that\
    \ are subject to global rate limits return the headers below:\n\n| Header name\
    \                    | Description                                           \
    \                           |\n| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Global-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests the account\
    \ is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`            |\
    \ The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.\
    \    |\n\nWe do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be\
    \ made globally. This limit may change, and we encourage clients to program against\
    \ the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding\
    \ to the current limit.\n\n### Route-level rate limits\n\nSome authenticated routes\
    \ have custom rate limits. These also reset every ten seconds. Any access tokens\
    \ hitting the same route share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access\
    \ token may impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to route-level rate limits\
    \ return the headers below:\n\n| Header name                   | Description \
    \                                                                            \
    \              |\n| ----------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Route-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests to the current\
    \ route the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`\
    \           | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch\
    \ milliseconds.                         |\n\nA _route_ represents a specific URL\
    \ pattern and verb. For example, the [Delete environment](/tag/Environments#operation/deleteEnvironment)\
    \ endpoint is considered a single route, and each call to delete an environment\
    \ counts against your route-level rate limit for that route.\n\nWe do not publicly\
    \ document the specific number of calls that an account can make to each endpoint\
    \ per ten seconds. These limits may change, and we encourage clients to program\
    \ against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather\
    \ than hardcoding to the current limits.\n\n### IP-based rate limiting\n\nWe also\
    \ employ IP-based rate limiting on some API routes. If you hit an IP-based rate\
    \ limit, your API response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how\
    \ long to wait before re-trying the call. Clients must wait at least `Retry-After`\
    \ seconds before making additional calls to our API, and should employ jitter\
    \ and backoff strategies to avoid triggering rate limits again.\n\n## OpenAPI\
    \ (Swagger) and client libraries\n\nWe have a [complete OpenAPI (Swagger) specification](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/openapi.json)\
    \ for our API.\n\nWe auto-generate multiple client libraries based on our OpenAPI\
    \ specification. To learn more, visit the [collection of client libraries on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-api+org%3Alaunchdarkly&type=Repositories).\
    \ You can also use this specification to generate client libraries to interact\
    \ with our REST API in your language of choice.\n\nOur OpenAPI specification is\
    \ supported by several API-based tools such as Postman and Insomnia. In many cases,\
    \ you can directly import our specification to explore our APIs.\n\n## Method\
    \ overriding\n\nSome firewalls and HTTP clients restrict the use of verbs other\
    \ than `GET` and `POST`. In those environments, our API endpoints that use `DELETE`,\
    \ `PATCH`, and `PUT` verbs are inaccessible.\n\nTo avoid this issue, our API supports\
    \ the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, allowing clients to \"tunnel\" `DELETE`,\
    \ `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests using a `POST` request.\n\nFor example, to call\
    \ a `PATCH` endpoint using a `POST` request, you can include `X-HTTP-Method-Override:PATCH`\
    \ as a header.\n\n## Beta resources\n\nWe sometimes release new API resources\
    \ in **beta** status before we release them with general availability.\n\nResources\
    \ that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change\
    \ without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.\n\nWe try to promote\
    \ resources into general availability as quickly as possible. This happens after\
    \ sufficient testing and when we're satisfied that we no longer need to make backwards-incompatible\
    \ changes.\n\nWe mark beta resources with a \"Beta\" callout in our documentation,\
    \ pictured below:\n\n> ### This feature is in beta\n>\n> To use this feature,\
    \ pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`.\
    \ Use this header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](/#section/Overview/Beta-resources).\n\
    >\n> Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development.\
    \ They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.\n\
    \n### Using beta resources\n\nTo use a beta resource, you must include a header\
    \ in the request. If you call a beta resource without this header, you receive\
    \ a `403` response.\n\nUse this header:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: beta\n```\n\n\
    ## Versioning\n\nWe try hard to keep our REST API backwards compatible, but we\
    \ occasionally have to make backwards-incompatible changes in the process of shipping\
    \ new features. These breaking changes can cause unexpected behavior if you don't\
    \ prepare for them accordingly.\n\nUpdates to our REST API include support for\
    \ the latest features in LaunchDarkly. We also release a new version of our REST\
    \ API every time we make a breaking change. We provide simultaneous support for\
    \ multiple API versions so you can migrate from your current API version to a\
    \ new version at your own pace.\n\n### Setting the API version per request\n\n\
    You can set the API version on a specific request by sending an `LD-API-Version`\
    \ header, as shown in the example below:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: 20220603\n```\n\
    \nThe header value is the version number of the API version you would like to\
    \ request. The number for each version corresponds to the date the version was\
    \ released in `yyyymmdd` format. In the example above the version `20220603` corresponds\
    \ to June 03, 2022.\n\n### Setting the API version per access token\n\nWhen you\
    \ create an access token, you must specify a specific version of the API to use.\
    \ This ensures that integrations using this token cannot be broken by version\
    \ changes.\n\nTokens created before versioning was released have their version\
    \ set to `20160426`, which is the version of the API that existed before the current\
    \ versioning scheme, so that they continue working the same way they did before\
    \ versioning.\n\nIf you would like to upgrade your integration to use a new API\
    \ version, you can explicitly set the header described above.\n\n> ### Best practice:\
    \ Set the header for every client or integration\n>\n> We recommend that you set\
    \ the API version header explicitly in any client or integration you build.\n\
    >\n> Only rely on the access token API version during manual testing.\n\n### API\

    \nTo manage legacy experiments, make the following PATCH requests to the flags\
    \ API:\n\n#### Adding an experiment\n\nTo add an experiment to a flag, add a new\
    \ object to the `/experiments/items/` property.\n\nThe object must contain:\n\n\
    1. The key of the metric you want to use for the experiment.\n2. (Optional) A\
    \ list of keys for the environments where the experiment should record data.\n\
    \n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n[\n    {\n        \"op\":\
    \ \"add\",\n        \"path\": \"/experiments/items/0\",\n        \"value\": {\n\

    : []\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### Removing an experiment\n\nTo remove an\
    \ experiment, remove the corresponding item from the experiments or items property.\n\
    \n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n[\n    {\n        \"op\":\
    \ \"remove\",\n        \"path\": \"/experiments/items/0\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n####\
    \ Starting or resuming an experiment\n\nTo start recording data for an experiment\
    \ in an environment, add the environment key to the list of environments for that\
    \ experiment.\n\n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n[\n    {\n\
    \        \"op\": \"add\",\n        \"path\": \"/experiments/items/0/environments/0\"\
    ,\n        \"value\": \"production\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### Stopping an experiment\n\
    \nTo stop collecting data for an experiment in a specific environment, remove\
    \ the environment from the list that experiment uses.\n\n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n\
    [\n  {\n    \"op\": \"remove\",\n    \"path\": \"/experiments/items/0/environments/0\"\
    \n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Updating the baseline\n\nTo update the baseline for all\
    \ experiments on a flag across all environments in the project, replace the `baselineIdx`\
    \ property with the index of the new baseline variation.\n\n```json\nPATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}\n\
    [\n  {\n    \"op\": \"replace\",\n    \"path\": \"/experiments/baselineIdx\",\n\

    \ \"replace\", \"path\": \"/name\", \"value\": \"New name\" }\n]\n```\n\nThe `variations`\
    \ array represents the different variation values that a feature flag has. For\
    \ a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and `false`. Multivariate flags\
    \ have more variation values, and those values could be any JSON type: numbers,\
    \ strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting rules, the variations are referred\
    \ to by their index into this array. Below are some specific examples.\n\n## Per-environment\
    \ configurations\n\nEach entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object\
    \ that represents the environment-specific flag configuration data available in\
    \ the flag's Targeting tab. For example, to toggle off a feature flag in your\
    \ production environment, use the following JSON patch operation:\n\n```json\n\
    [\n    { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/environments/production/on\", \"value\"\
    : false }\n]\n```\n\nTo learn more, read [Targeting users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).\n\
    \nEach section of the Targeting tab corresponds to a different attribute of the\
    \ per-environment configuration data, as shown here:\n\n## Individual user targets\n\
    \nThe `targets` array in the per-environment configuration data represents the\
    \ individual user targeting rules on the Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Targeting\
    \ users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).\n\nEach object\
    \ in the `targets` array represents a list of user keys assigned to a particular\
    \ variation. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    ...\n    \"environments\" : {\n \
    \       \"production\" : {\n            ...\n            \"targets\": [\n    \
    \            {\n                    \"values\": [\"foo@example.com\"],\n     \
    \               \"variation: 0\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n\
    \    }\n}\n```\n\nThis `targets` array here means that user `foo@example.com`\
    \ receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. Recall that the\
    \ variations are stored at the top level of the flag JSON in an array, and the\
    \ per-environment configuration rules point to indexes into this array. If this\
    \ is a boolean flag, `foo@example.com` is receiving the `true` variation.\n\n\
    ## Targeting rules\n\nThe `rules` array corresponds to the custom targeting rules\
    \ section of the Targeting tab. This is where you can express complex rules on\
    \ attributes with conditions and operators. For example, a rule like \"roll out\
    \ the `true` variation to 80% of users whose email address ends with `gmail.com`\
    \ could be expressed here. To learn more, read [Creating targeting rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users#creating-targeting-rules).\n\
    \n## The fallthrough rule\n\nThe `fallthrough` object is a special rule that contains\
    \ no conditions. It is the rollout strategy that is applied when none of the individual\
    \ or custom targeting rules match.\n\n## The off variation\n\nThe off variation\
    \ represents the variation to serve if the feature flag is turned off, meaning\
    \ the `on` attribute is `false`. For boolean flags, this is usually `false`. For\
    \ multivariate flags, set the off variation to whatever variation represents the\
    \ control or baseline behavior for your application. If you don't set the off\
    \ variation, LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.\n\
    \n## Percentage rollouts\n\nThe `weight` attribute defines the percentage rollout\
    \ for each variation. Weights range from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout).\
    \ The weights are scaled by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can\
    \ be represented without using floating-point. For example, a weight of `50000`\
    \ means that 50% of users that don't otherwise match any `targets` will see that\
    \ variation. The sum of weights across all variations should be 100%.\n"

    \ when you create a webhook. If you define the secret, the webhook `POST` request\
    \ will include an `X-LD-Signature header`, whose value will contain an HMAC SHA256\
    \ hex digest of the webhook payload, using the `secret` as the key.\n\nCompute\
    \ the signature of the payload using the same shared secret in your code to verify\
    \ that the webhook was triggered by LaunchDarkly.\n\n## Understanding connection\
    \ retries\n\nIf LaunchDarkly receives a non-`2xx` response to a webhook `POST`,\
    \ it will retry the delivery one time. Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If\
    \ you build an integration on webhooks, make sure it is tolerant of delivery failures.\n"

    \nA workflow is a set of actions that you can schedule in advance to make changes\
    \ to a feature flag at a future date and time. You can also include approval requests\
    \ at different stages of a workflow. To learn more, read [Workflows](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows).\n\
    \nThe actions supported are as follows:\n\n- Turning targeting `ON` or `OFF`\n\
    - Setting the default variation\n- Creating a rule to target a group of users\
    \ by segment\n- Modifying the rollout percentage for rules\n\nYou can create multiple\
    \ stages of a flag release workflow. Unique stages are defined by their conditions:\
    \ either approvals and/or scheduled changes.\n"

    \ are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without\
    \ notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.\n\n\nWorkflow templates allow\
    \ you to define a set of workflow stages that you can use as a starting point\
    \ for new workflows. You can create these workflows for any flag in any environment\
    \ and any project, and you can create as many workflows as you like from a given\
    \ template.\n\nYou can create workflow templates in two ways:\n* by specifying\
    \ the desired stages, using the `stages` property of the request body\n* by specifying\
    \ an existing workflow to save as a template, using the `workflowId` property\
    \ of the request body\n\nYou can use templates to create a workflow in any project,\
    \ environment, or flag. However, when you create a template, you must specify\
    \ a particular project, environment, and flag. This means that when you create\
    \ a template using the `stages` property, you must also include `projectKey`,\
    \ `environmentKey`, and `flagKey` properties in the request body. When you create\
    \ a template from an existing workflow, it will use the project, environment,\
    \ and flag of the existing workflow, so those properties can be omitted from the\
    \ request body.\n\nTo learn more, read [Workflows documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows)\
    \ and [Workflows API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Workflows-(beta)).\n"

      tags:
      - Feature flags
  /api/v2/flags/{projectKey}:
    get:
      description: "Get a list of all features in the given project. By default, each\
        \ feature includes configurations for each environment. You can filter environments\
        \ with the `env` query parameter. For example, setting `env=production` restricts\
        \ the returned configurations to just your production environment. You can\
        \ also filter feature flags by tag with the tag query parameter.\n\n### Filtering\
        \ flags\n\nYou can filter on certain fields using the `filter` query parameter.\
        \ For example, setting `filter=query:dark-mode,tags:beta+test` matches flags\
        \ with the string `dark-mode` in their key or name, ignoring case, which also\
        \ have the tags `beta` and `test`.\n\nThe `filter` query parameter supports\
        \ the following arguments:\n\n- `query` is a string that matches against the\
        \ flags' keys and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `archived` is a boolean\
        \ with values of `true` or `false` that filters the list to archived flags.\
        \ Setting the value to `true` returns only archived flags. When this is absent,\
        \ only unarchived flags are returned.\n- `type` is a string allowing filtering\
        \ to `temporary` or `permanent` flags.\n- `status` is a string allowing filtering\
        \ to `new`, `inactive`, `active`, or `launched` flags in the specified environment.\
        \ This filter also requires a `filterEnv` field to be set to a valid environment.\
        \ For example: `filter=status:active,filterEnv:production`.\n- `tags` is a\
        \ `+` separated list of tags. It filters the list to members who have all\
        \ of the tags in the list. For example: `filter=tags:beta+test`.\n- `hasExperiment`\
        \ is a boolean with values of `true` or `false` that returns any flags that\
        \ are used in an experiment.\n- `hasDataExport` is a boolean with values of\
        \ `true` or `false` that returns any flags that are exporting data in the\
        \ specified environment. This includes flags that are exporting data from\
        \ Experimentation. This filter also requires that you set a `filterEnv` field\
        \ to a valid environment key. For example: `filter=hasDataExport:true,filterEnv:production`\n\
        - `evaluated` is an object that contains a key of `after` and a value in Unix\
        \ time in milliseconds. This returns all flags that have been evaluated since\
        \ the time you specify in the environment provided. This filter also requires\
        \ you to set a `filterEnv` field to a valid environment. For example: `filter=evaluated:{\"\
        after\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production`.\n- `filterEnv` is a string\
        \ with the key of a valid environment. You can use the `filterEnv` field for\
        \ filters that are environment-specific. If there are multiple environment-specific\
        \ filters, you should only declare this parameter once. For example: `filter=evaluated:{\"\
        after\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production,status:active`.\n\nBy default,\
        \ this returns all flags. You can page through the list with the `limit` parameter\
        \ and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned\
        \ `_links` field. These links will not be present if the pages they refer\
        \ to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing\
        \ from the response on the first page.\n\n### Sorting flags\n\nYou can sort\
        \ flags based on the following fields:\n\n- `creationDate` sorts by the creation\
        \ date of the flag.\n- `key` sorts by the key of the flag.\n- `maintainerId`\
        \ sorts by the flag maintainer.\n- `name` sorts by flag name.\n- `tags` sorts\
        \ by tags.\n- `targetingModifiedDate` sorts by the date that the flag's targeting\
        \ rules were last modified in a given environment. It must be used with `env`\
        \ parameter and it can not be combined with any other sort. If multiple `env`\
        \ values are provided, it will perform sort using the first one. For example,\
        \ `sort=-targetingModifiedDate&env=production&env=staging` returns results\
        \ sorted by `targetingModifiedDate` for the `production` environment.\n- `type`\
        \ sorts by flag type\n\nAll fields are sorted in ascending order by default.\
        \ To sort in descending order, prefix the field with a dash ( - ). For example,\
        \ `sort=-name` sorts the response by flag name in descending order.\n"

    patch:
      description: "Perform a partial update to a feature flag. The request body must\
        \ be a valid semantic patch or JSON patch.\n\n### Using semantic patches on\
        \ a feature flag\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nThe body of a semantic\
        \ patch request for updating feature flags requires an `environmentKey` in\
        \ addition to `instructions` and an optional `comment`. The body of the request\
        \ takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description\
        \ of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly\
        \ environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the\
        \ update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a\
        \ `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters,\
        \ you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object.\n\n\
        ### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions\
        \ for updating feature flags.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions\
        \ for turning flags on and off</summary>\n\n#### turnFlagOff\n\nSets the flag's\
        \ targeting state to **Off**.\n\nFor example, to turn a flag off, use this\
        \ request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"example-environment-key\"\
        ,\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnFlagOn\n\
        \nSets the flag's targeting state to **On**.\n\nFor example, to turn a flag\
        \ on, use this request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"example-environment-key\"\
        ,\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n</details><br\
        \ />\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for working with\
        \ targeting and variations</summary>\n\n#### addClauses\n\nAdds the given\
        \ clauses to the rule indicated by `ruleId`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`:\
        \ ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauses`: Array of clause objects, with `attribute`\
        \ (string), `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings,\
        \ numbers, or dates) properties.\n\n#### addPrerequisite\n\nAdds the flag\
        \ indicated by `key` with variation `variationId` as a prerequisite to the\
        \ flag in the path parameter.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `key`: Flag key of\
        \ the prerequisite flag.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation of the prerequisite\
        \ flag.\n\n#### addRule\n\nAdds a new targeting rule to the flag. The rule\
        \ may contain `clauses` and serve the variation that `variationId` indicates,\
        \ or serve a percentage rollout that `rolloutWeights` and `rolloutBucketBy`\
        \ indicate.\n\nIf you set `beforeRuleId`, this adds the new rule before the\
        \ indicated rule. Otherwise, adds the new rule to the end of the list.\n\n\
        ##### Parameters\n\n- `clauses`: Array of clause objects, with `attribute`\
        \ (string), `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings,\
        \ numbers, or dates) properties.\n- `beforeRuleId`: (Optional) ID of a flag\
        \ rule.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation of the flag.\n- `rolloutWeights`:\
        \ Map of `variationId` to weight, in thousandths of a percent (0-100000).\n\
        - `rolloutBucketBy`: (Optional) User attribute.\n\n#### addUserTargets\n\n\
        Adds user keys to the individual user targets for the variation that `variationId`\
        \ specifies. Returns an error if this causes the flag to target the same user\
        \ key in multiple variations.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user\
        \ keys.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag.\n\n#### addValuesToClause\n\
        \nAdds `values` to the values of the clause that `ruleId` and `clauseId` indicate.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauseId`:\
        \ ID of a clause in that rule.\n- `values`: Array of strings.\n\n#### clearUserTargets\n\
        \nRemoves all individual user targets from the variation that `variationId`\
        \ specifies.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation on\
        \ the flag.\n\n#### removeClauses\n\nRemoves the clauses specified by `clauseIds`\
        \ from the rule indicated by `ruleId`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`:\
        \ ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauseIds`: Array of IDs of clauses in the\
        \ rule.\n\n#### removePrerequisite\n\nRemoves the prerequisite flag indicated\
        \ by `key`. Does nothing if this prerequisite does not exist.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n- `key`: Flag key of an existing prerequisite flag.\n\n#### removeRule\n\
        \nRemoves the targeting rule specified by `ruleId`. Does nothing if the rule\
        \ does not exist.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n\
        \n#### removeUserTargets\n\nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets\
        \ for the variation that `variationId` specifies. Does nothing if the flag\
        \ does not target the user keys.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of\
        \ user keys.\n- `variationId`: ID of a flag variation.\n\n#### removeValuesFromClause\n\
        \nRemoves `values` from the values of the clause indicated by `ruleId` and\
        \ `clauseId`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n\
        - `clauseId`: ID of a clause in that rule.\n- `values`: Array of strings.\n\
        \n#### reorderRules\n\nRearranges the rules to match the order given in `ruleIds`.\
        \ Returns an error if `ruleIds` does not match the current set of rules on\
        \ the flag.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleIds`: Array of IDs of all rules\
        \ in the flag.\n\n#### replacePrerequisites\n\nRemoves all existing prerequisites\
        \ and replaces them with the list you provide.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `prerequisites`:\
        \ A list of prerequisites. Each item in the list must include a flag `key`\
        \ and `variationId`.\n\nFor example, to replace prerequisites, use this request\
        \ body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"example-environment-key\",\n\
        \  \"instructions\": [\n    {\n      \"kind\": \"replacePrerequisites\",\n\

        \n### Using JSON Patches on a feature flag\nIf you do not include the header\
        \ described above, you can use [JSON patch](/reference#updates-using-json-patch).\n\
        \nWhen using the update feature flag endpoint to add individual users to a\
        \ specific variation, there are two different patch documents, depending on\
        \ whether users are already being individually targeted for the variation.\n\
        \nIf a flag variation already has users individually targeted, the path for\
        \ the JSON Patch operation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"op\": \"add\",\n  \"path\"\
        : \"/environments/devint/targets/0/values/-\",\n  \"value\": \"TestClient10\"\
        \n}\n```\n\nIf a flag variation does not already have users individually targeted,\
        \ the path for the JSON Patch operation is:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"op\"\
        : \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/-\",\n    \"value\"\
        : { \"variation\": 0, \"values\": [\"TestClient10\"] }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n\n\
        ### Required approvals\nIf a request attempts to alter a flag configuration\
        \ in an environment where approvals are required for the flag, the request\
        \ will fail with a 405. Changes to the flag configuration in that environment\
        \ will require creating an [approval request](/tag/Approvals) or a [workflow](/tag/Workflows-(beta)).\n\
        \n### Conflicts\nIf a flag configuration change made through this endpoint\
        \ would cause a pending scheduled change or approval request to fail, this\
        \ endpoint will return a 400. You can ignore this check by adding an `ignoreConflicts`\
        \ query parameter set to `true`.\n"

    patch:
      description: "Schedule a user for removal from individual targeting on a feature\
        \ flag. The flag must already individually target the user.\n\nYou can add,\
        \ update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only schedule a user\
        \ for removal on a single variation per flag.\n\nThis request only supports\
        \ semantic patches. To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        #### addExpireUserTargetDate\n\nAdds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will\
        \ remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove\
        \ the user from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`: The version\
        \ of the flag variation to update. You can retrieve this by making a GET request\
        \ for the flag.\n* `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual\
        \ targeting\n\n#### updateExpireUserTargetDate\n\nUpdates the date and time\
        \ that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly\
        \ should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`:\
        \ The version of the flag variation to update. You can retrieve this by making\
        \ a GET request for the flag.\n* `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove\
        \ from individual targeting\n\n#### removeExpireUserTargetDate\n\nRemoves\
        \ the scheduled removal of the user from the flag's individual targeting.\
        \ The user will remain part of the flag's individual targeting until you explicitly\
        \ remove them, or until you schedule another removal.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n* `variationId`: The version of the flag variation to update. You can retrieve\
        \ this by making a GET request for the flag.\n* `userKey`: The user key for\

      description: "Update a flag trigger. Updating a flag trigger uses the semantic\
        \ patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating\
        \ flag triggers.\n\n#### replaceTriggerActionInstructions\n\nRemoves the existing\
        \ trigger action and replaces it with the new instructions.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n- `value`: An array of the new `kind`s of actions to perform when triggering.\
        \ Supported flag actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.\n\nFor example,\
        \ to replace the trigger action instructions, use this request body:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n  \"comment\": \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [\n    {\n  \
        \    \"kind\": \"replaceTriggerActionInstructions\",\n      \"value\": [ {\"\
        kind\": \"turnFlagOff\"} ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### cycleTriggerUrl\n\n\
        Generates a new URL for this trigger. You must update any clients using the\
        \ trigger to use this new URL.\n\n#### disableTrigger\n\nDisables the trigger.\
        \ This saves the trigger configuration, but the trigger stops running. To\
        \ re-enable, use `enableTrigger`.\n\n#### enableTrigger\n\nEnables the trigger.\
        \ If you previously disabled the trigger, it begins running again.\n"

  /api/v2/members:
    get:
      description: "Return a list of account members.\n\nBy default, this returns\
        \ the first 20 members. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter\
        \ and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned\
        \ `_links` field. These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't\
        \ exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the\
        \ response on the first page.\n\n### Filtering members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports\
        \ the following fields for filters:\n\n- `query` is a string that matches\
        \ against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `role`\
        \ is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. It filters the list to\
        \ members who have any of the roles in the list. For the purposes of this\
        \ filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.\n- `team` is a string that matches\
        \ against the key of the teams the members belong to. It is not case sensitive.\n\
        - `noteam` is a boolean that filters the list of members who are not on a\
        \ team if true and members on a team if false.\n- `lastSeen` is a JSON object\
        \ in one of the following formats:\n  - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that\
        \ have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation\
        \ to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.\n\
        \  - `{\"noData\": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly\
        \ began recording last seen timestamps.\n  - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}`\
        \ - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should\
        \ be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.\n- `accessCheck` is a string\
        \ that represents a specific action on a specific resource and is in the format\
        \ `<ActionSpecifier>:<ResourceSpecifier>`. It filters the list to members\
        \ who have the ability to perform that action on that resource. \n  - For\
        \ example, the filter `accessCheck:createApprovalRequest:proj/default:env/test:flag/alternate-page`\
        \ matches members with the ability to create an approval request for the `alternate-page`\
        \ flag in the `test` environment of the `default` project.\n  - Wildcard and\
        \ tag filters are not supported when filtering for access.\n\nFor example,\
        \ the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole` matches members with the string\
        \ `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case, who also are either an `Owner`\
        \ or `Admin` or have the custom role `customrole`.\n\n### Sorting members\n\
        \nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName` and `lastSeen`:\n\
        \n- `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the member's email if\
        \ no name is set.\n- `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen` property. LaunchDarkly\
        \ considers members that have never been seen or have no data the oldest.\n"

        \ the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that\
        \ returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist.\
        \ For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response\

        \ to the first page when you are already on the first page.\n\n### Filtering\
        \ projects\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:\n- `query` is\
        \ a string that matches against the projects' names and keys. It is not case\
        \ sensitive.\n- `tags` is a `+` separate list of project tags. It filters\
        \ the list of projects that have all of the tags in the list.\n\nFor example,\
        \ the filter `query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches projects with the string\
        \ `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`.\
        \ The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\n### Sorting projects\n\nLaunchDarkly\
        \ supports two fields for sorting:\n- `name` sorts by project name.\n- `createdOn`\
        \ sorts by the creation date of the project.\n\nFor example, `sort=name` sorts\
        \ the response by project name in ascending order.\n\n### Expanding the projects\
        \ response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the \"List projects\"\
        \ response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\
        \nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated\
        \ list with the `environments` field.\n\n`Environments` includes a paginated\
        \ list of the project environments.\n* `environments` includes a paginated\
        \ list of the project environments.\n\nFor example, `expand=environments`\
        \ includes the `environments` field for each project in the response.\n"

        \ are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\

        - `name` sorts by environment name.\n- `createdOn` sorts by the creation date\

      description: "\nUpdate a scheduled change, overriding existing instructions\
        \ with the new ones. Updating a scheduled change uses the semantic patch format.\n\
        \nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n\
        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating\
        \ scheduled changes.\n\n#### deleteScheduledChange\n\nRemoves the scheduled\
        \ change.\n\n#### replaceScheduledChangesInstructions\n\nRemoves the existing\
        \ scheduled changes and replaces them with the new instructions.\n\n#####\
        \ Parameters\n\n- `value`: An array of the new actions to perform when the\
        \ execution date for these scheduled changes arrives. Supported scheduled\
        \ actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.\n\nFor example, to replace the\
        \ scheduled changes, use this request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\":\
        \ \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [\n    {\n      \"kind\": \"\
        replaceScheduledChangesInstructions\",\n      \"value\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\"\
        } ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateScheduledChangesExecutionDate\n\nUpdates\
        \ the execution date for the scheduled changes.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`:\
        \ the new execution date, in Unix milliseconds.\n"

      description: "Create a workflow for a feature flag. You can create a workflow\
        \ directly, or you can apply a template to create a new workflow.\n\n### Creating\
        \ a workflow\n\nYou can use the create workflow endpoint to create a workflow\
        \ directly by adding a `stages` array to the request body.\n\n_Example request\
        \ body_\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Progressive rollout starting in two days\"\
        ,\n  \"description\": \"Turn flag on for 10% of users each day\",\n  \"stages\"\
        : [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"10% rollout on day 1\",\n      \"conditions\"\
        : [\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"schedule\",\n          \"scheduleKind\"\
        : \"relative\",\n          \"waitDuration\": 2,\n          \"waitDurationUnit\"\
        : \"calendarDay\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"action\": {\n        \"instructions\"\
        : [\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"\n          },\n   \
        \       {\n            \"kind\": \"updateFallthroughVariationOrRollout\",\n\
        \            \"rolloutWeights\": {\n              \"452f5fb5-7320-4ba3-81a1-8f4324f79d49\"\
        : 90000,\n              \"fc15f6a4-05d3-4aa4-a997-446be461345d\": 10000\n\
        \            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n###\
        \ Creating a workflow by applying a workflow template\n\nYou can also create\
        \ a workflow by applying a workflow template. If you pass a valid workflow\
        \ template key as the `templateKey` query parameter with the request, the\
        \ API will attempt to create a new workflow with the stages defined in the\
        \ workflow template with the corresponding key.\n\n#### Applicability of stages\n\
        Templates are created in the context of a particular flag in a particular\
        \ environment in a particular project. However, because workflows created\
        \ from a template can be applied to any project, environment, and flag, some\
        \ steps of the workflow may need to be updated in order to be applicable for\
        \ the target resource.\n\nYou can pass a `dry-run` query parameter to tell\
        \ the API to return a report of which steps of the workflow template are applicable\
        \ in the target project/environment/flag, and which will need to be updated.\
        \ When the `dry-run` query parameter is present the response body includes\
        \ a `meta` property that holds a list of parameters that could potentially\
        \ be inapplicable for the target resource. Each of these parameters will include\
        \ a `valid` field. You will need to update any invalid parameters in order\
        \ to create the new workflow. You can do this using the `parameters` property,\
        \ which overrides the workflow template parameters.\n\n#### Overriding template\
        \ parameters\nYou can use the `parameters` property in the request body to\
        \ tell the API to override the specified workflow template parameters with\
        \ new values that are specific to your target project/environment/flag.\n\n\
        _Example request body_\n```json\n{\n\t\"name\": \"workflow created from my-template\"\
        ,\n\t\"description\": \"description of my workflow\",\n\t\"parameters\": [\n\
        \t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3b\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/clauses/0/values\"\
        ,\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": [\"updated-segment\"]\n\t\t\t\
        }\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3d\",\n\t\t\t\"path\"\
        : \"/variationId\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd12\"\
        \n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nIf there are any steps in the template that\
        \ are not applicable to the target resource, the workflow will not be created,\
        \ and the `meta` property will be included in the response body detailing\
        \ which parameters need to be updated.\n"

    patch:
      description: "Update a user segment. The request body must be a valid semantic\
        \ patch, JSON patch, or JSON merge patch.\n\n### Using semantic patches on\
        \ a segment\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\
        \ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\
        \ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nThe body of a semantic\
        \ patch request for updating segments requires an `environmentKey` in addition\
        \ to `instructions` and an optional `comment`. The body of the request takes\
        \ the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description\
        \ of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly\
        \ environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the\
        \ update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a\
        \ `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters,\
        \ you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object.\n\n\
        ### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions\
        \ for updating segments.\n\n#### addIncludedUsers\n\nAdds user keys to the\
        \ individual user targets included in the segment. Returns an error if this\
        \ causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.\n\n##### Parameters\n\
        \n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### addExcludedUsers\n\nAdds user keys\
        \ to the individual user targets excluded from the segment. Returns an error\
        \ if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.\n\n#####\
        \ Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### removeIncludedUsers\n\
        \nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets included in the segment.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### removeExcludedUsers\n\
        \nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets excluded from the segment.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### updateName\n\n\
        Updates the name of the segment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Name of\
        \ the segment.\n\n## Using JSON patches on a segment\n\nYou can also use JSON\
        \ patch. To learn more, read [Updates using JSON patches](/reference#updates-using-json-patch).\n\
        \nFor example, to update the description for a segment, use the following\
        \ request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"replace\"\
        ,\n      \"path\": \"/description\",\n      \"value\": \"new description\"\
        \n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo update fields in the segment that are arrays, set\
        \ the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Using\
        \ `/0` adds the new entry to the beginning of the array.\n\nFor example, to\
        \ add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:\n\n```json\n{\n\
        \  \"patch\":[\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/rules/0\"\
        ,\n      \"value\": {\n        \"clauses\": [{ \"attribute\": \"email\", \"\
        op\": \"endsWith\", \"values\": [\".edu\"], \"negate\": false }]\n      }\n\
        \    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo add or remove users from segments, we recommend\
        \ using semantic patch. Semantic patch for segments includes specific `instructions`\
        \ for adding and removing both included and excluded users.\n"

        \ have 0 members\n  - A request with `nomembers:false` returns teams that\
        \ have 1 or more members\n\n### Expanding the teams response\nLaunchDarkly\
        \ supports four fields for expanding the \"List teams\" response. By default,\
        \ these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\nTo expand the response,\
        \ append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with\

        \ the semantic patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must\
        \ append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type`\
        \ header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\
        \n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind`\
        \ instructions for updating teams.\n\n#### addMembersToTeams\n\nAdd the members\
        \ to teams.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `memberIDs`: List of member IDs to add.\n\
        - `teamKeys`: List of teams to update.\n\n#### addAllMembersToTeams\n\nAdd\
        \ all members to the team. Members that match any of the filters are excluded\
        \ from the update.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `teamKeys`: List of teams to update.\n\
        - `filterLastSeen`: (Optional) A JSON object with one of the following formats:\n\
        \  - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those\
        \ who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged\
        \ in after being provisioned via SCIM.\n  - `{\"noData\": true}` - Members\
        \ that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.\n\
        \  - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since\
        \ the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.\n\
        - `filterQuery`: (Optional) A string that matches against the members' emails\
        \ and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `filterRoles`: (Optional) A `|`\
        \ separated list of roles and custom roles. For the purposes of this filtering,\
        \ `Owner` counts as `Admin`.\n- `filterTeamKey`: (Optional) A string that\
        \ matches against the key of the team the members belong to. It is not case\

        \ ignores all data outside the first column. Headers are optional. To learn\
        \ more, read [Managing team members](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/teams/managing#managing-team-members).\n\
        \n**Members are only added on a `201` response.** A `207` indicates the CSV\
        \ file contains a combination of valid and invalid entries. A `207` results\
        \ in no members being added to the team.\n\nOn a `207` response, if an entry\
        \ contains bad user input, the `message` field contains the row number as\
        \ well as the reason for the error. The `message` field is omitted if the\
